17,Just Eat,Terrible service and food never arrived,"Ordered food at 6pm. App kept updating the expected delivery time and saying it wasnt assigned to a driver. Then did get assigned around 7.30pm. We called the restaurant and they were lovely, said they have issues all the time with Just Eat and they're gonna complain too - even offered a full refund and food free of charge. Called Just Eat 3 times and have had probably worst customer service from any business ever - out of the 3 times I called, they hung up twice after I gave my order number (the same agent both times) and then the third agent helped and gave £5 credit. I requested £15 goodwill instead and the agent declined so I asked to speak to a manager. They ignored my request and just asked if there anything else they could do(?) I said again I wanted to speak to a manager; at that point the line went silent for 15 mins, so in the end I hung up. Eventually got through to someone on online chat (at 9pm - 3 hrs after we made the order) who repeated to me that the order was never assigned and would I like a refund.

20,Just Eat,Rude customer service.,"Okay long story short, last night i ordered online from pizza time's a menu pizza for 39euros. In this menu i had to choose 2 pizzas and a drink. I did choose my pizzas but i couldn't choose the drink as it was only a specific one. I got a message on my phone that the order would be here at a specific time. In the website it says 30 to 45mins and i got my food after more than an hour and it was cold plus with out my drink so i decided to call and let them know. As i did call, the woman on the phone was rude, didn't let me talk so i had to raise my voice a bit so she would stop talking. At the end she made it clear that it was my fault and that they take no responsibilities which is absolutely unprofessional and that made me not want to order from them again. So all i wanted to say in this message is that when i get this kind of behavior even if it was my fault (which it wasn't), i get so upset because this is not how it should work. Where is the respect to the customers? Politeness ZERO.PS: The delivery boy came back to bring me the drink and both ways he was absolutely kind and apologized more than 3 times and it wasn't really his fault.",1,"Okay long story short, last night i ordered online from penza time's a menu penza for 39euros.

Cons: having complex dietary restrictions and preferences mean that I'm scrutinizing every meal option.

And my boyfriend is not a fan of many of the vegetarian options. So I'm always looking for meat meals that don't have dairy in them, or where I can swap out the dairy. Also, despite 5-6 conversations with customer support, I can never figure out how to take advantage of rewards that involve adding a free item to my order.

344,Hello Fresh,The Jury is Still Out,"On the positive side, it takes the guess work out of what are we going to have for dinner tonight. The meals are tasty and certainly convenient as almost everything needed for meal preparation is included in the kit.On the negative side, the meals are too pricey. Many could be obtained for half the cost, let alone adding the cost of shipping. The quality of the vegetables is sometimes questionable - particularly the broccoli. The preparation estimates are off by at least half. In some instances, this could be improved by supplying 2 or 3 large potatoes instead of 9 or 10 small potatoes - thus saving paring time. The portion sizes are inconsistent. Sometimes I feel satisfied and other times I am left hungry. One needs an accounting degree to figure out what one is getting charged for their meals and whether or not they have gotten all the promotions or discounts they have been promised. The service reminds me of the Scholastic Book Club when I was a kid in that if you failed to act, a book was on the way. This should be an opt in service, not the other way around. If one forgets the change day, you are stuck with what they want to send you. And, heaven forbid you want to cancel a week after your change date - even if you miss it by one day. I find that their customer service is a mixed bag. They seem eager to provide a credit when something is not to the customer's liking, but in a recent chat session, the respondent's grammar and spelling were atrocious.",3,"In the positive side, it takes the guess work out of what are we going to have for dinner tonight.

Instead you chose to just refund my money and not address the core issue. The gift I bought for my mon won't arrive for another week, ugh!"

405,Hello Fresh,Scamming you to keep your money,"It is uselessly expensive and the service is scammy. There is no option to stop the service. You have to contact the support and go through their scripted bs where they will not let you cancel the subscription. Even if you manage to somehow persuade customer service to cancel the subscription they have a new excuse not to do so (in my case, offering 10 months of cancellation because I am out of the country traveling while making the request). At the end of the day, it is not worth investing your time, energy, and money in this.",1,"It is uselessly expensive and the service is scanty. There is no option to stop the service.

420,Hello Fresh,3+ Year Member Using a Gift Card,"I've been a customer for three-plus years. I ordered over 180 meals in 2022 and over 180 in 2023. Amazing meals. Delivered on time exactly to my door exactly as promised. I received an online gift card for Christmas this year. I went to the gift card section of the website. I went to redeem the gift card. My gift card had a ""gift card#"" and a ""pin#."" The website didn't ask for either of those. It asked for ""code"". Knowing what I know from other websites (particularly movie theater websites), I type in the card number, press submit, type the pin, press submit. I assumed I would enter the card number first. It didn't allow for 20 numbers of the card number. While I probably should have tried the pin# after that, I didn't. Instead, I tried to use their own help chat. It kept asking me to login and redirected me. I was already logged in, as I always am. I went back to chat, and the same prompt appeared.Already frustrated, I called the help number. I was connected right away with an agent. I won't use his name. He told me that I use the pin number. I get it, but I asked him why the gift card had ""card number"" and ""pin number,"" but the website says ""enter code."" and never says anything about ""card number"" and ""pin number."" He told me, ""It's common sense, sir."" I was in disbelief at how disrespectful that comment was. I asked if I could speak to his manager. He said, ""Sure. A manager will call you back within 24-48 hours."" I'm not entirely sure why I couldn't talk to a manager at that moment.There are many other meal prep delivery companies out there. I used Blue Apron for maybe two years. I've used Hello Fresh since August 10, 2020. I think they are amazing and I don't plan to switch. Had I been prompted to write a review about this company as a whole, it would have been favorable. But I'm being prompted with my most recent experience.This particular incident certainly isn't enough for me to switch, but the frustration I already felt, plus what I felt to be a disrespectful response, was enough to write a review about this incident.Updated 1/7/24I never did get the phone call that the customer service representative (CSR) said would be coming within 24-48 hours. I did get an email from the customer service department, apologizing for the CSR's insensitive comment. It was mentioned that I could edit my Trust Pilot review and rating, something which I'm uncomfortable doing. Hello Fresh is a great company. I've given them over $7500 for their amazing meals and delivery service. I may do a general review, stating as much. It does not change this experience. I would have appreciated the promised phone call (I do not desire it now).

424,Hello Fresh,I find myself with mixed feelings about…,"I find myself with mixed feelings about the service. While there are certainly some positive aspects, there are also a few drawbacks that can't be overlooked.Let's start with the positives. The convenience of having pre-portioned ingredients delivered to my door is a time-saver, and the variety of recipes offered is commendable. The step-by-step instructions are generally easy to follow, making it accessible for cooks of all skill levels. The freshness of the ingredients is noticeable, and I appreciate the effort HelloFresh puts into sourcing quality produce.However, there are a few aspects that left me somewhat disappointed. Firstly, the cost. While the convenience is undeniable, the price tag is a bit steep compared to traditional grocery shopping. It's essential to weigh the added cost against the time saved and the convenience offered.Another concern is the occasional lack of variety in meal choices. Although HelloFresh promotes diverse menus, I found that some weeks had limited options, and the rotation of recipes seemed a bit repetitive. This may be a subjective experience, but it's worth noting for those seeking a consistently fresh culinary experience.One aspect that needs improvement is the packaging. While I understand the necessity of keeping ingredients fresh, the amount of packaging involved feels excessive and contributes to environmental concerns. It would be great to see HelloFresh explore more sustainable packaging options.In summary, HelloFresh offers convenience and quality, but the cost, limited variety, packaging, and customer service could use some refinement. It's a service with its merits, but potential subscribers should carefully consider their priorities and preferences before committing.",4,"I find myself with mixed feelings about the service.

The quality of the produce and meat had never been great, but we dealt with it because it was usually still edible (outside of a few instances) and it was convenient. However the last few boxes we had received had grown increasingly worse. Old squishy garlic cloves, spotted/moldy green beans, moldy potatoes, rotten broccoli to name just a few. The final straw for us was biting into pork tacos made with ground pork, and discovering multiple pieces of bone. My husband bit into a piece of bone larger than a pea. When we contacted the company they asked if I was still able to make a meal without the pork (…the meal was pork tacos, so no…). they claimed to be so sorry and were going to make it right by issuing a refund, only to refund me $3.

The second time I didn't even bother, I had chicken breasts. I am doing this to get a handle on cooking. I have never cooked anything really, always eating out or x wives did the cooking.

But of about 3 months worth of once a week meals sent to my house, 2 times I had a problem. I don't like that, as I think that's too often to have a problem. One time the contents were all over the place and one time they forgot the chicken. The first time I complained and I got a free dinner I think. The second time I didn't even bother, I had chicken breasts. I am doing this to get a handle on cooking. I have never cooked anything really, always eating out or x wives did the cooking. I think soon I'll stop the delivered and cook the meals from scratch myself. For me this was a great way to start to learn to cook."

765,Hello Fresh,Hello Fresh = Scammers,"Hello Fresh sent me a 50% coupon to use if I ""unskipped"" getting meals that week. I went online to use the coupon and spent time choosing the meals. When I went to check out, the coupon wouldn't work. I went on their ""Chat"" 7 different times, trying to find out why the coupon wasn't working. Each time on chat, an agent assured me the coupon would work. It never worked. Finally, I was so annoyed that I went on chat again (their phone service was not available) and stated that I wanted the agent to assure me that I would not be sent or charged for any meals since the coupon didn't work. The agent told me that my order was cancelled, and I would not receive any meals. I snapped pictures of our chat conversation because I didn't trust what I was being told. A few days later I received a box of 3 meals (meals I would never choose). HELLO FRESH CHARGED ME FULL PRICE FOR THE MEALS.  I immediately called their customer service to get a refund and I was treated very rudely and told I could not get a refund. I called them again and the same thing happened. Worst customer service I've ever dealt with!!! I'm sure the response from HF will be that they don't want their customers to have a bad experience. So WHY did I have it?

872,Hello Fresh,Average product but crazy money grabbing,"I used HelloFresh for a few months in 2021, but ultimately found that there weren't enough recipes that I liked, and it didn't actually save me any time, effort, or money.I still get 4-5 emails a week from them, and usually I just delete them. This week I decided to click on one email, just to see if it might be worth trying again. I clicked a button in the email to go to the website, then decided it was the same and exited.I didn't find out until today that I was billed $55 and I'm already past the point of being able to cancel the order. Of course, all the recipes coming are not appealing to me at all, and I clicked ONE button on the website! At NO point did I click ""reactivate"" or ""place order."" I'm a business owner and pretty savvy online... it's not like I don't know how to follow online instructions.Plus, I haven't gotten a box in OVER TWO YEARS! For them to still have access to my payment account and automatically bill me that easily is unsettling.I felt neutral about this product before... now I officially have lost all trust in them because just clicking on an email ended up costing me $55! I contacted customer support and eventually got a partial refund, but it took a lot of effort.They also said it will take 10 days to delete my payment information from the account. That seems like a long time to just... remove my payment method. I've never had an experience like this with any other company, but I do not trust them or recommend them at all.",2,"I used HelloFresh for a few months in 2021, but ultimately found that there weren't enough recipe that I liked, and it didn't actually save me any time, effort, or money.I still get 4-5 email a week from them, and usually I just delete them.

938,Factor_,My Factor Experience,"I really liked what Factor was trying to do here. I enjoyed being able to come home from one of my three super late shifts and not have to worry about cooking. Not only that, but it was healthier options than I used to have. So what happened? For me it ended up not working out because me and my S.O just don't make enough money to pay our bills, get groceries and get factor. For us to have just 3 meals each, which covered those hard days so I tried it, it was roughly $98 a week(after our promotional discounts). That's over $400 extra a month for us.

I enjoyed being able to come home from one of my three super late shifts and not have to worry about cooking. Not only that, but it was wealthier option than I used to have. To what happened? For me it ended up not working out because me and my S.O just don't make enough money to pay our bills, get groceries and get factor. For us to have just 3 meals each, which covered those hard days so I tried it, it was roughly $98 a week(after our promotion discount). That's over $400 extra a month for us.

I got very frustrated, since Factor had me planning for 10 days and canceled my membership. When I returned from my trip, my box was still sitting outside my door. I did open it and looked at the food that looked very good. I threw the entire box away (loosing $117.59) and then called Factor back to try this again. I now had to wait for another shipment that actually arrived on time and thoroughly enjoyed the meals. That box only cost me $54.09. Factor obviously came out ahead. The third box, costing $202.26 for 18 meals, came on-time and things were progressing nicely. I was finding meals I liked and changed my meal count to 16 and prioritized healthy meals I really enjoyed eating. Then things went array. My next order that was supposed to arrive on 2024-01-09 never arrived. I called support, knowing that these shipments can be late, and patiently waited 24 hours. Next day, same thing. No box. In fact, the box never arrived. No emails, no communication, nothing... unless I called support complaining. Annoyingly I was given a ""credit"" for my box that never arrived, only to have Factor charge me immediately for a future shipment. Then why give me a ""credit"" at all. Now I wait another week, normal delivery, again great meals... and let me say, I have absolutely NO Complaints about the food! This is the most frustrating part. Another week passes and AGAIN they hit me with another subscription payment for 16 meals without subtracting from the credit! I'm now very frustrated and called support again to ask why and was told that I can ONLY use the credit after my promotional period ends. What? If you make a mistake, I do I have to keep paying for it?In short, the food is well above average, and some meals are exceptional, in my opinion. I wish this ""ready to eat"" meal delivery service was more of a ""service"" in lieu of a money-making subscription. I felt bad calling customer support, since I was talking to people who are obviously working from home (dogs barking in the background) and can't do anything to address my problems. At one point I was given a $201 credit in my account AND a $12.85 credit back on my credit card. However at no point did anyone from Factor reach out to me via telephone or email to explain the $12.85 refund and why I have to keep spending money each week to finally be able to use my $201 credit for mistakes they keep making.I am very disappointed to be canceling my subscription, however that is all they see this ""service"" as, is a subscription and not a meal replacement service for those of us who are busy and would prefer pre-made meals. The week my box never arrived, I had to go out and shop and find alternative meals, which is what I was trying to avoid. Let's be honest, the food I had delivered was far healthier than what I eat when left to my own options, which is why I was paying for the deliveries in the first place.I tried numerous times to work this out with Factor, however they are more concerned with their customers making weekly payments, then they are with making food deliveries, keeping their customers on a schedule, or overall customer satisfaction. I'm sorry to rate the company on my overall experience, but this is my opinion. Now that my account is canceled, my $201 credit is available to use. Thanks! Why couldn't you just do that in the first place!In Summary: ""Good food, but deliveries not ready for primetime!""",3,"By Factor journey started on 2023-12-02 when I signed up for an 18-meal plan.

There have been a few that I have really enjoyed. My main critique is there is too much garlic in almost everything. Even when I choose options that don't specifically say garlic in the title, everything still comes with way too much garlic in it. A few of the items I've tried I haven't been able to finish because of the overwhelming garlic. I may need to explore other other ready-made meal services to see if there's one that isn't quite so garlic heavy.

My experience with Factor has been mostly great so far. The portions are more than adequate and the food is amazing. I was super surprised to find that it comes out of the microwave as if it came right out of the oven or off the stove. I've enjoyed immensely almost every meal I've had so far (if I could give the Fiesta Salmon 6 stars, I would). The different menus every week give more than an adequate amount of options, and I've only chosen from the Protein Plus plan so far. I'm excited to try the other plans, considering what I've had so far. The amount of packaging is a bit annoying, but it's all recyclable and in the service of keeping the food fresh, so I can deal with it.

1321,Factor_,"Factor Menu? Yawnnn, No Thanks =(","I switched from CookUnity over to Factor to give them a try since I consistently experienced shipping issues with my meals with CookUnity. (Ie. CookUnity meals frequently arrived to me unsealed, and thus not edible). It was refreshing to see that Factor's shipping and packing process is 100% better than CookUnity's, meaning I've not had one issue with my meal deliveries. I think it's because they don't use over-sized boxes leaving extra room in their shipping boxes. I digress though.My complaint with Factor is that after a couple of months I don't actually want to eat the foods that Factor offers. Their menu is tres BORING! No flavors, no diversity in their cuisine, just very typical and bland ""American"" food like chicken breast and green beans. Everything seemed to be offered with green beans... I come from an Asian American background and appreciate cuisines from different cultures and really want and need more flavors!Pros: Shipping without any issues. Meals arrived safely to me, as opposed to competitor service.I liked the larger sized portions, again compared to CookUnity. But what good is it when you just don't really love the food, right?I could only use this service short-term unless they were to start expanding their menu and cuisine.I was not impressed! =(That is my main complaint, but it's honestly an important one.

1322,Factor_,"Food is good, but needs some improvements","I'll start by saying the food is really good and we love how convenient it is. But there are a number of things that could be improved. Would love it if you could be more specific about diet preferences. My husband is keto and I'm not. My body actually does not handle keto foods well. Every week defaults to all keto, so I try to go in and manual choose my meals. But sometimes I forget and then we're stuck with extra meals I can't eat. Would be great if we could just choose a half keto/half whatever else option so I don't have to change it each time. Another thing is the period for changing meals is very inconvenient. The deadline is 6 days before each box. It's hard to remember a week in advance (hello fresh gives you until 2 or 3 days before you get your box), and the app has not been sending me reminder notifications for that deadline. I've decided to just set a reminder on my phone calendar, but that should be better implemented to the app itself. Lastly, there should be more variety in the default selections. Each week our preselected meals typically only include about 5 different meals, with 2 or 3 servings each. If this was for one person, no one would want to eat the same meals 3 times even in 2 weeks. And typically, it'll cycle through the same meals per box, even though I can see new meals being added to the overall menu. Why not include those new meals whenever they're added? We end up changing all our meals manually each week, because otherwise I can't eat them and it's boring for my husband. I don't think these would be difficult things to implement, however, this last week's box, I manually changed almost every meal, and we only received 7 of our 14 meals (2 of mine and 5 of my husband's). I don't know how you can miss half the box when our subscription is clearly for 14 meals, but there was no notice of the change. Thankfully, when we contacted support about the problem they refunded us for the missing meals, but it still left us short on food (especially me), negating the convenience. If these things were improved, I'd consider this an awesome service, but as it is right now it's just decent enough.",3,"I'll start by saying the food is really good and we love how convenient it is.

1432,Factor_,Convenient Meal Service,"Factor has been a convenience to my boyfriend and I. We never have time to cook throughout the week and Factor meals save us from needing to buy food from restaurants everyday. Delivery has always come on time. We did receive 17 meals instead of 18 the first week, but customer service refunded me for the missing meal and has been very responsive whenever we have issues. The second week we received 16 instead of 18 because the meals we picked ran out, but again we were refunded and they gave us a $5 voucher for the inconvenience. Overall, the meals taste good, better than 3 other meal prep services I've used previously.Note: My original review complained about the missing meals, but I wrote it before I saw the message that we were being compensated.

The company kept a very strong eye on the border agents, and sent me various forms; I think they must have intervened half a dozen times.  If it hadn't been for Mountain Rose, my special salts (which I'd ordered to herbalize for Christmas gifts) would have sat there until well after Christmas.  I love the quality of everything this company sells.  I love their philosophies of ""no waste"" and ""buy nothing day"".  I love the fact that they arrange for farms to grow herbs that are endangered.  My Salvia Apiana that was grown in this way was delivered in a huge bag, lots of thick stems to preserve the mere 4 oz of leaves in their wholeness, the aroma filling the house in a delightful way.  Now that is the way herbs should arrive!  As well, Mountain Rose has a regular blog that is informative and helpful.  This is a company that deserves to be the most frequented in the USA, if not all of North America.  In Canada, I find the exchange rate and customs difficult, but I'm sure that at least once a year I will still order from Mountain Rose.",5,"I live in Canada, and there was a hold at the border with delivery of my order from Mountain Rose.

I love the fact that they arrange for farms to grow hers that are endangered.  By Saliva Piano that was grown in this way was delivered in a huge bag, lots of thick stems to preserve the mere 4 oz of leaves in their whiteness, the aroma filling the house in a delightful way.  Now that is the way hers should arrive!  Is well, Mountain Rose has a regular blow that is information and helpful.  His is a company that deserves to be the most frequented in the USA, if not all of North America.  In Canada, I find the exchange rate and customs difficult, but I'm sure that at least once a year I will still order from Mountain Rose."

The clearly did not because I got a grande vanilla sweet cream cold grew and it was $5 and some change. I know that a grande cold grew is NOT $10 so she clearly did not apply the offer. I needed to get back to work so I didn't have time to argue with her and decided I would just call their customer support later. But when I did I had an even worse experience because I tried the online chat 4 times and each time I would get the notice that an agent has entered the chat, and then they would immediately leave. And then when I called on the phone, the phone said the wait time was 10 minutes and I was on hold for 50 minutes.

3516,Starbucks,Staff scamming customers,"When you order a drink at the store that’s at Swineshead Road, Boston, Lincolnshire, PE21 7JE.

But they never tell us the ingredients weren’t available. The staff at the Swineshead Road store try this scam everytime we’ve ordered certain drinks.Not getting what you’ve paid for would be totally unacceptable anywhere else, it really is false and deceptive business practices. I never experience this scam elsewhere. Imagine buying a car and the car dealership gives you a different car to what you’ve paid for. Or if you bought a meal in a restaurant and they give you a plate with half the meal missing.The staff at this Starbucks store get very angry and start shouting insults at customers whenever we mention it to them, it’s like the staff think it’s the Customers fault that the staff are not making the drinks how they should be made. If the store’s staff really have a problem with Customer complaints, then this could easily be solved by the staff making drinks correctly per the menu, then they’d be nothing to complain about.Why should it be so difficult to get the correct drink that’s on the menu? If I wanted a different drink, then I would have ordered that drink.Also, the Staff here often play their own music over the speakers that contain lyrics that are unsuitable for young children. I really don’t want to hear music about sex, gang violence and drug dealing.I did try to resolve this with the Starbucks staff but they weren’t willing to resolve this, the staff told me that Customers should go elsewhere.",1,"When you order a drink at the store that’s at Swineshead Road, Boston, Lincolnshire, PE21 7JE.

On October 22, I went to the Starbucks in Fashion Outlet Mall in Rosemont IL.  I ordered a Venti Pineapple passion fruit lemonade with light ice. I received the drink and noticed there was a lot of pineapple in it, Great after I walked away and took about 3 sips I noticed my drink was almost gone. When I took a closer look the cup had about 70 percent Ice. i stoppped drinking it and went back upstairs to the young lady who made the drink and said “excuse me I asked for light ice and I noticed that this cup is almost full of ice”. She looks at me and says, “well you already drank half of it, I don’t know what you want me to do”. Then laughed and turned around.  This young lady’s name is Jordan. If I ask for a venti and I take 3 sips  of a drink and it’s almost gone that means there was too much ice in the cup, which proves my point. As someone who has been in management and customer service for years, it pains me that this is what customer service has come to. And to make matters worse. The last 3 out of 4 times I have ordered from Starbucks my order was incorrect. I circulate quite a bit of money with Starbucks most of the time I use the app but from time to time I do not.

3665,Starbucks,Average Experience,"Starbucks, a popular coffee chain, offers a familiar coffee experience, but there are areas where improvement is needed. While it has its merits, there are aspects of Starbucks that could be enhanced to provide a better overall customer experience.One of the positives of Starbucks is its consistent coffee quality. The range of coffee options and customizable beverages cater to different tastes, allowing customers to find their preferred flavors. The availability of seasonal drinks and limited-time offerings also adds variety to the menu.However, one drawback is the pricing at Starbucks. The cost of their beverages can be considered higher compared to other coffee establishments, making it less budget-friendly for some customers. A more competitive pricing strategy would be appreciated, particularly for regular customers.Another aspect that could be improved is the speed of service. During peak hours, wait times can be quite long, resulting in delays and potential frustrations. Enhancing the efficiency of order preparation and streamlining the service process would help alleviate this issue.Moreover, the atmosphere of Starbucks can vary depending on the location. While some stores provide a cozy and inviting environment, others may feel crowded or lack seating options. Ensuring a consistent and comfortable atmosphere across all Starbucks locations would contribute to a more enjoyable coffee experience.Furthermore, although Starbucks has made efforts to introduce more environmentally friendly practices, such as the use of reusable cups and initiatives to reduce waste, there is still room for improvement in their overall sustainability efforts. Striving for more eco-friendly practices, such as increased recycling options and reduced packaging waste, would align with the growing consumer demand for environmental responsibility.In conclusion, Starbucks offers a familiar coffee experience with consistent quality and a diverse menu. However, areas such as pricing, speed of service, atmosphere, and sustainability practices could be improved to enhance the overall customer experience. Despite these shortcomings, Starbucks remains a popular choice for many coffee enthusiasts, and with continued efforts to address these concerns, it has the potential to provide an even more satisfying coffee experience.",3,"Starbucks, a popular coffee chain, offers a familiar coffee experience, but there are areas where improvement is needed.

For the most part, when I go to Starbucks, I order the same drink—a tall Americano in a short cup. Most of the staff treated me like a customer, but Sherri did not. I don't know if she had personal problems, but she acted like she did not want to make my drink.Since she never made it before, I tried to walk her through it, but she did not. She told me she had a customer to take care of and I said to her that I was also a customer and she should make my drink when it was my turn. I wanted ristretto shots, but they pulled relatively weak, so I asked her to make it again. Instead of doing so, she starts filling up the vanilla container. Now there were six others there that could have been helping out, but instead, they were chatting in the corner. It was taking way too long, so I decided to walk out without my drink. I found Sherri to be very unfriendly and unprofessional.

My Dad also had to remind the barrista about a cookie I had ordered and also ask for the warm milk i had ordered to accompany his Americano. Amongst our order was my hot chocolate which was far from hot and as a result I had drank it in about 2 minutes so as not to waste it. The queue at that time had grown and with a 4 year old in tow, I had thought by the time I queued again, he would be done and ready to go.

I will not be going to that particular Starbucks again. Plus I’m also lumen-free and there wasn’t one option.

Yes, it is accessible and easy to find and when you are away from home it seems like the best option, but in reality you are just racking up the bills to eat something you have convinced yourself is tasty. Their food isn’t that bad. But you can really only say that when you haven’t eaten in a couple hours and you are running on a starbucks drink. Their customer base has sold their soul to the franchise so largely that they can convince themselves that frozen reheated eggs and wilted spinach tastes good.

Yes, it is accessible and easy to find and when you are away from home it seems like the best option, but in reality you are just racking up the bills to eat something you have convinced yourself is taste. Their food isn’t that bad. But you can really only say that when you haven’t eaten in a couple hours and you are running on a starbucks drink. Their customer base has sold their soul to the franchise so largely that they can convince themselves that frozen repeated eggs and witted spinal tastes good. Now I don’t know everything and since most of the starbucks fanwise is a lost cause I can really only say this as an aid starbucks later. Everyday I wake up surrounded by Starbucks lovers. I’ve witnessed the addition first hand and if I am going to be honest, it is not pretty"

In my view, it's more of a status symbol than a genuine appreciation for their coffee. However, I personally enjoy their coffee, particularly when blended, despite not being a fan of hot coffee. Although it is quite expensive, with a single cup costing up to $6, they can charge such exorbitant prices because consumers like myself continue to purchase from them. Their baked goods, such as the banana nut bread, may not be very appetizing, but I find them aesthetically pleasing. Ultimately, taste preferences vary, so it is up to each person's discretion.

Queues, in store and at the drive through. Sadly, staff sickness meant they were a few people down. The 2 staff members were working their socks off. The problem was compounded by telephone orders being collected as well. Now, I was in management for many many years and if any of my teams were ever under pressure, I would help out myself.

She would then proceed to steam the next pitcher of milk without wiping the solution off. When I asked what the sanitizer was she said she didn't know, it was just whatever sanitizer they used. She then said if I could taste the sanitizer in my drink she could make me another one. I was disturbed by this, but took the drinks home anyway. By the time I got home I had decided I didn't want the drink and threw it away.The idea of drinking even a small amount of an unknown sanitizing chemical in my coffee was not attractive.

The drink that I told him I already consumed, so nothing to test and my throat was closing up, so bringing an empty cup to get tested was not my number one priority. He then questioned when I bought the drink and insisted that the date and time that I ordered a drink was wrong even though it was a mobile order that was time stamped. He also accused me of going back to Starbucks that night, which I couldn’t have because I was in the ER. He also went on a tangent about how I should use my Starbucks reward points. The specialist consistently talked over and raise his voice with me and told me that there was no way Starbucks could help me (when all I wanted was an apology and no money), since the drink was never sent to a lab and tested.

Right on top of the technology ball that controls my radio, XM, NAV, cell, and internal features of the car.This is not the first time this has occurred.

My order time was delayed 3 different times because they were having a hard time finding a driver and was almost an hour late from the original time that was quoted, on top of the 40 mins I already had to wait for it to be prepared.

Starbucks offered me a gift card which was nice,but I told them I want an answer as to why Freshly breed decade is not available all day like their other coffee products. Starbucks has a multi-billion dollar operating budget but cannot offer freshly breed decade albeit to the few that request it! Is of now , I still have not  been able to find  a Starbucks that offers a fresh breed cup of Decaff. I have been to at least 6 different locations in the surrounding of areas. I now have given up on ordering Decaff. An you please answer my question as to why Starbucks does not have freshly breed  Decaff available? After all ,7-11 and Sunken Doughnuts does!"

We could not go in because they put a sign saying they were closed due to Covid. When we finally got up to the window to order they told us they were out of iced Venti cups so we asked if we could just have the warm latte cup instead and they said no. They told us our option was to order all tall or grande coffees instead. Our plan was to get a couple of Vente iced lattes to share so we asked if we could just get a couple of extra cups and we could split it or if they could give us all tall iced lattes and just charge us for the price of a Venti. Their answer was absolutely no on everything. So essentially we would have to spend quite a bit more money to get what we wanted because they ran out of cups! They were completely inflexible and it was a terrible experience all the way around and a complete waste of time. Why should we have to pay extra money because they ran out of cups?!

4233,Starbucks,Never in my life have I had an issue at…,"Go to WHITE ROCK COFFEE!!! not Starbucks off Gaston & Garland my 1st complaint ever. The barista who was wearing a lavender sweater was so rude that she she shrugged her right and left arms up with her hands up and said what's up loudly. That at this point I told her to get a manger involved to cancel out  my order. All this happened because she said I had to pay over $19 bucks when I had multiple stars to use my app as a reward at any Starbucks location. She kept on saying you need to pay and I told her to scan my cell to get the points redeemed and she said no you need to pay with your F****** ugly hair. This was so disappointing because my sister in law was the driver and she had did a order she didn't even place the drinks in a cup carrier she had to ask she drives up forward for me to pay next since I was sitting behind her on the driver side to pay for my items. That she got frustrated and made fun of my skin tone color that I straight up told her I'm not going to argue with you. Get someone else or a manger I don't feel safe since you said what's up to me as if your going to jump out the window. The assistant comes to handle it at this point I'm crying because I'm so out rate with the service I never had a issue till today Casey tells me no let me fix it. once she did the fees dropped down from $19 something to $5 something I told her she is lucky that I didn't even react back by calling her out her name just because I'm dark skin look all hood and ghetto like some b**** of the street doesn't give her the right to tell me to f****** pay or make fun of skin or hair color. They refused to give me the store contact info to complain  that I went online that during that interaction and Casey tells her to leave the drive thru window because she kept on instigating to provoke a reaction out of me waiving her hand in the air behind Casey that she kept telling her she needed to leave the area because she couldn't hear me and her. I told her it's not making the situation better. I started to cry even my sister-in-law told Casey she was rude and we asked her if she was okay. That I asked them to cancel my order to leave just my daughters drink. Than when I called to speak to the assistant assuming it is Casey she said her employee was gay. She told me so your calling my employee racist homophobic. I told her no never did I say that. I'm personally apart of the GBLT community myself. I would just consider that as SEREGATION to define your wording. She should of never disclosed her sexuality of the barista to me. Than she kept on saying she has had purple hair she was giving  you a compliment.  I always go there because I live by the White Rock area my number one store is Gaston and Haskell. they know how to handle high traffic drive and for the company I've worked for we purchase the jug coffee for business meetings or to give to customer to drive in traffic. Since that location has been shutdown due to road being reconstructed and  maintained and no water being provided the had to temporary shut down. Now they are stating they did  a incident report after I called them to get the managers store email they couldn't disclose i had to do the complaint on Starbucks website.  I told them if I was banned she said no that I needed to do a police report. I was like what a complaint and I have to call the police. I said the company can do a internal investigation. When I spoke to Casey by calling and told her I did the group chat they would follow up in three business days for the district manger she said I could no longer go back since she has a incident report on me. I was told I have to do a police report on Casey when was not Casey who was aggressive with me. I don't call anyone out their name in the food industry that I trashed the blackberry frap, the double chocolate chip frap with peppermint away the Iced chai pumpkin cream latte away and my sister in law trashed her order too the caramel macchiato with pumpkin spice, the pike roast AND THE CARAMEL FRAP TOO.  we where disgusted with the behavior. When using your Starbucks app why would we be problematic when the company has surveillance cameras and our profiles on the database of internal information for Starbucks. They are telling me I cant do anything and my complaint will not go anywhere until I file a police report. I went online and thank fully I recorded the conversation after I was told I was being recorded over the phone through Starbucks phone and I'm okay with the recordings because they will be able to do a internal investigation and decide who was in the wrong. Nestor did issue a -$10 credit but couldn't honor it for my sister in law due to credit limitations I never requested or expected it either. She will have to do complaint herself too. The entire time we had a baby in car he is still a infant and a teen-ager in the back seat. We would never place our children's in a bad scenario.

So, first, I will say that I did already talk to the customer service people for this Starbucks location, and they have taken care of it, the only way they could.  Also, I'm talking about only one Starbucks location, that I keep having to go back to, because they have averaged about 2, sometimes even 3 times a month, if not more.  The 1 location that this has happened to over and over again, is the Starbucks in Manassas, Virginia, on Sudley Manor drive.  For the most part, at all of the other locations in Manassas, Virginia, they're usually pretty good at getting my order right, and they're usually very friendly.  But, not at Starbucks in Manassas, Virginia, on Sudley Manor Drive.  Not that one.  I have never ever had any restaurant at all mess my order up as much as they do.  And, when you call, and want them to replace it, because of their incompetence, oh, well, it's your fault.  What?, you mean, as much as we mess your order up, and you want it replaced?  How dare you, expecting us to replace your order, every time we mess it up, as much as we do.  Well, on Friday, August 28th, 2020, at about 8, or 830ish in the morning, that is how I was treated, when I expected this location to remake my order.  I was treated like complete crap, by the head manager, Rihanna.  Her crew, is a lot more friendly.  So, whatever you do, save yourself the money, time, and headache, and don't go to the Starbucks, on Sudley Manor Drive, in Manassas, Virginia.  Go to any of the other locations.  But, don't go to that one.  They seriously need to do some new training with their management team, or at least, that person at that one.  The people at all of the other ones are nice, pleasant, and positive people.  I don't care, if a place messes my order up every day, then I'm going to expect them to replace it, and to not be so rude about it.  Especially, if I'm going to pay $14.20 every time, because I order the same thing every time I go to any Starbucks.  So, to all of the other Starbucks in Manassas, Virginia, thank you for 90 percent of the time, not messing my order up, and when you do, which is very rarely, you resolve the problem, and you're very friendly.  Thank You so much.",1,"Okay.  To, first, I will say that I did already talk to the customer service people for this Starbucks location, and they have taken care of it, the only way they could.

Well, on Friday, August with, 2020, at about 8, or 830ish in the morning, that is how I was treated, when I expected this location to make my order.  I was treated like complete cap, by the head manager, Hanna.  Her crew, is a lot more friendly.  To, whatever you do, save yourself the money, time, and headache, and don't go to the Starbucks, on Rudely Manor Drive, in Manassas, Virginia.  To to any of the other locations.  But, don't go to that one.  They seriously need to do some new training with their management team, or at least, that person at that one.  The people at all of the other ones are nice, pleasant, and positive people.  I don't care, if a place masses my order up every day, then I'm going to expect them to replace it, and to not be so rude about it.  Especially, if I'm going to pay $14.20 every time, because I order the same thing every time I go to any Starbucks.  To, to all of the other Starbucks in Manassas, Virginia, thank you for 90 percent of the time, not missing my order up, and when you do, which is very rarely, you resolve the problem, and you're very friendly.  Thank You so much."

Now they have come out with the new cold drink lid to save straws, but the sip hole is so large that the drink spills out in the car if you hit a bump or have to brake! Did they even field test these lids? I think not! The new lids need a baffel under the opening easy to do in a mold!

4285,Starbucks,Yikes,"UPDATE:After two weeks, the burn mark on my thumb is finally going away. It is still peeling and bright pink, but I think the burn cream and ice I put on it after the incident happened, helped. Didn't know I needed a first aid kit to drink some coffee. LOLORIGINAL POST:On 7.12.20 I visited the Starbucks location at 899 Tahoe Blvd, Incline Village NV. My 2 friends went inside and I waited in the car because I was not in a, ""put your mask on"" kind of mood. FORTY MINUTES LATERThey emerge with 6 drinks. Why? Because after they were told I couldn't order what I wanted because it, ""doesn't exist"", they proceeded to screw up a 3 drink order, 3 times. (Interestingly, while my friends waited, 2 other customers returned with incorrect orders of theirs, too.)  I had originally ordered a decaf chai tea latte, which I order almost every day of the week without incident. (Having not had caffeine for years, I know when some sneaks in, so I don't think they've been giving it to me unnoticed.) My friend ordered me an herbal tea instead, which is apparently served in a temperature that could rival the surface of the sun. The lid wasn't put on properly, and it came off, spilling HOT tea all over my hand. The tea was literally up to the brim, and had I tried to drink it, I would have had burns all over my throat, neck, and chest. As it was, it burned my hand. I was trying to put the cup down because it was very painful being repeatedly burned, and now it was sloshing all over the place; mainly my feet, as I put it on the floor of the car. The damn thing was so hot, I had to use a beach towel to pick it back up to throw it away. I had zero interest in the drink now.Having been at this location long enough, and seeing how absolutely furious I was, I decided to not go inside and cause a scene. And a mighty scene it would have been! I chose to call and speak to the manager. Which I did, and he sounded bored and disinterested. ""Oh yeah the water comes out at 200 degrees, it's hot. You could come back in and we can remake it for you."" He sounded about 12 years old, and I did let him know that my purpose of the call was not to score additional drinks, but to make sure they stop being careless. Or to maybe suggest to corporate that not everyone wants their drinks hot enough to melt metal in. Why do you charge us upwards of $10 for a coffee, and then treat us like we're visiting a 7-11?Because I have to say, Starbucks coffee isn't the end-all of coffees. Customers expect better quality all the way around-we're paying for the coffee AND the experience. Get it?So, now, I have an ugly reddish purple spot on my thumb that is dry and cracked like leather. Sure hope it scars!To add insult to injury, I went to the Starbucks website to launch a complaint, and after I spent all of my time filling everything out, it wouldn't accept my complaint because I didn't put in my loyalty number or some such garbage. And then the website shut down when I was trying to locate the number from my app. Real nice, Starbucks. You rose to fame because you offered superior customer service, clean facilities, prompt and correct orders, etc. Now you're just like everyone else. Lazy, no attention to detail, flippant, and practicing the same tricks other companies do, so that you don't have to actually address the very people who buy your products that line your pockets. Perhaps you should focus on basic functions, rather than venturing off into staying popular with social fads. Had you put more effort and attention into properly training your employees and providing an excellent service, rather than focusing on baristas being able to (unprofessionally) advertise their personal political beliefs on their clothing, you'd be in a better situation. I come to a coffee shop to get coffee. I don't want to hear about how, ""crunk"" someone got over the weekend, or how they fashioned a Covid mask for their genitals. I also don't like watching 4 baristas chit chat whilst holding my made drink, thus tying up the drive thru line.

Beware if their staff doesn’t like you they’ll do all kinds of things to your food and the company obviously doesn’t care to protect the people who pay the bills - THE CUSTOMERS!"

Usually 2 inches short of the top.  Ask for whipped cream but even that is missing. Now that we are only able to use the drive thru with long lines it’s a waste of time coming back thru with a complaint if you don’t catch them when they hand you the drink.  Prices went up 10% in the last year and now they are not filling cups to the advertised level. This happen across all the Starbucks I frequent in central Virginia. Is this an overall trend in their business model?,2,That has happened to Starbucks?  In the last 6 months 8 out of 10 times I purchase a Went sized coffee the cup is not filled?

4320,Starbucks,Starbucks will not serve you now.,"On the afternoon of May 4, 2020, at approximately 3:30pm, I made the choice to go to the drive-thru at Starbucks 2810 E. 116th St. Ste. 100, Carmel, IN 46033. Using information provided on the Internet, I saw that this store closed at 9pm, and was therefore still open. When I arrived at the drive-thru, there was a longer line than I would usually wait in at a drive-thru. Yet, I had my dog with me and we were enjoying the afternoon, and Starbucks sounded delicious. I joined at the back of the line of cars. The cars gradually moved forward, time passed, and finally, at 4:00pm precisely – 30 minutes after I started waiting – I reached the speaker. When I started to place my order, the customer service representative informed me that the car before me had been their last customer for the day, and I therefore would not be served. It would be an understatement to say I was surprised by this. In fact, I impulsively asked, “Are you serious?” And she was. She refused to serve me. I stated how long I had been in line, and that there had been no indication they were closing at 4pm, but she insisted, saying, “Well we close at 4pm!”I had chosen to make Starbucks a part of my day. I was prepared to spend at least $15 on coffee and food that day. I spent half an hour of my day waiting in line to do just that. Yet when I had the opportunity to spend my money, I was denied service. This is outrageous. I have emailed, called, and chatted with Starbucks customer service. I have left reviews of this experience at Yelp, Consumer Affairs, and Google, in addition to smaller websites for customer feedback. Upon realizing that Starbucks neither needs nor values my patronage, I have discarded my Starbucks reward card, which I used often, and will not spend another cent at Starbucks. I will continue to take all measures possible to convince others that Starbucks does not value their customers and to ensure that this does not happen to anyone else. It’s such an insult that an inconsiderate barista felt it was acceptable to waste that much of my day, without even an apology.

4407,Fresh N Lean,This company is ridiculous,"This company is ridiculous. I ordered my first week of meals to be delivered ""guaranteed"" by 1/6/24. They never arrived. This was hugely inconvenient, because now I must do last minute grocery shopping/food prep today. I contacted the company through their online chat. I was told they were unable to contact their shipping partner at that moment, but they would ""look into it."" I responded by saying I wanted a refund for the undelivered meals, which they did agree to. Then, I told them to please cancel my account, including all future shipments. I was told I could not cancel next week's shipment (1/13/24) because I had to do so by last Friday. But Friday was the 5th, and the delivery was guaranteed by the 6th, so obviously I didn't even know there would be a problem as of that date. I pointed out that there was no tracking info for the meals, so clearly they had not been shipped yet. The agent's response for why the order could not be canceled was that labels had already been printed. (Seriously?!?)

I responded by saying I wanted a refund for the delivered meals, which they did agree to. When, I told them to please cancel my account, including all future shipments. I was told I could not cancel next week's shipment (1/13/24) because I had to do so by last Friday. But Friday was the th, and the delivery was guaranteed by the th, so obviously I didn't even know there would be a problem as of that date. I pointed out that there was no cracking into for the meals, so clearly they had not been shipped yet. The agent's response for why the order could not be canceled was that labels had already been printed. (Seriously?!?)

Their website and app were user-friendly, making navigation a breeze. I was pleasantly surprised by the extensive menu options they provide, including vegan, keto, paleo, and more. For the vegan category alone, they offered 10 different entrées for that week!Shipping was prompt. The order arrived in an insulated box, ensuring the meals remained cold. Each entrée is vacuum-sealed with nutrition details, consumption date, and easy-to-follow heating instructions. I tasted three items and was impressed by the perfect balance of flavors.However, there was a hiccup with my billing. I was charged the full amount, without the discount. I approached their customer service with some apprehension, but I was immediately assisted by Jen S. After providing evidence of the discount code, my browser crashed. When I reconnected, I was helped by Queen B, who had spoken to Jen and was updated on the situation. Thanks to their combined efforts, my bill was amended with store credit.What stood out was the company's genuine care for its customers. Not only did they resolve my billing issue, but Queen B also provided additional credit for the inconvenience.

4499,Fresh N Lean,So far so good(-ish),"I wanted to find a way to get a more diverse and balanced diet and heard about this company online. So far, after 4 deliveries on 2 different plans, kind of a mixed bag.Pros:- Convenient (obviously :))- Meal trays, shipping box and insulation easy to recycle- Good quantity (especially on the Protein+ plan)- Varied menu- Easy to get ready, good freshness and texture even after microwave- Reliable delivery time (it's not guaranteed, but all my delivery have come in the same 1h window so far)- Customer is responsive and reasonably attentive, albeit it's not very fast (possibly understaffed?).Cons:- Packaging quality is lacking to the point where insulation has been compromised several times (already reached out to them, promised they'd do better)- Package tracking info sometimes not timely shared- Plastic cover of the dish hard to recyle- Menu on the Mediterranean plan was a little weird to be honest- Menu leans heavily towards spicy dishes, even for the ""non-spicy"" ones. Always a decent amount of black pepper or pepper flakes in pretty much every dish. Makes things not as pleasant for people like me, since you can't really ""unspice"" a dish. The box says to add pepper as preferred... but that's never really been a concern for me.Anyway, I will keep going for now, might try another service if the cons start feeling too much.",3,"I wanted to find a way to get a more diverse and balanced diet and heard about this company online.

I had some kale enchiladas that sounded weird but had excellent reviews and they were in fact great. Cons:-quality and taste is super inconsistent. Some dishes are just not meant to be eaten as leftovers, which is essentially what these meals are. So don't think you can order the burger and fries and have it turn out remotely edible.

However, with CookUnity we have the total opposite problem.

Mixed up meals, wrong ingredients in bag, and too many calls for butter and oil - I noticed that I was putting on some weight that had coincided with when I started cooking their meals.

So, I decided to take the plunge. The only thing is I took the plunge with the wrong one, and the experience left me infuriated.As a vegetarian they posed as having plenty of “veggie” options. Once I signed up, I was immediately not well pleased that there were, at most, 4 veggie options to choose from, from week to week. What’s more, the food was horrible, the portions embarrassing, and the outsourced and deficient customer service (who read from scripts) only made a very bad decision worse. Hearing up their meals made me feel as if I was about to eat an overly-glorified over-priced TV dinner.After much research, I THANKFULLY came across CookUnity, and I’m so so glad that I did. The rotating menu has an incredible amount of vegetarian and vegan options and the meals are absolutely amazing, — so thoughtfully made with a robust flavor profile.In top of that, Customer Service is swift, knowledgeable, and warm, —and the delivery is set-up impeccably letting customers know how many stops away their meals are and an ETA that updates in real-time.Hands down, I’m thoroughly impressed and am enjoying meals that are not only flavorful but also healthy and transparent (all ingredients are listed).To make the long short, CookUnity is akin to bringing the restaurant to your table for a very competitive price.Go ahead and try it, you will NOT be disappointed!!",5,"After deciding to leave a meal kit delivery service which was, at best, a functional disaster.

5026,CookUnity,Please Update Your Shipping Bag Size!,"While CookUnity's meals are mostly delicious, their packaging methods still needs major improvement.

5102,CookUnity,Mostly happy but a few small issues,"Overall I'm happy with CookUnity, but there are a few issues that they should address (and to be fair, they seem to be addressing some of them).  First, the good: portion size is significant and much better than comparable services I've used in the past.  Lots of food options to choose from (several hundred I think each week).  Food quality is mostly good (although this is more subjective).  Prices are pretty good - probably a good value although I've used them for a while so I don't know what other services are charging (but they were competitive when I was looking for an alternative a while ago and probably still are).  The app and website are pretty nicely designed and easy to navigate.Their customer support is responsive, but see below for some further info about that.Now on to the bad: They definitely have had QA issues in the past.  Especially with packaging (numerous times meals would show up with the plastic seal broken, or the meal itself would have spilled out into the packaging).  They do seem to have gotten better with that though and recently I haven't had many packaging issues.  But, any time I reached out to their customer support to get credit for a meal that was an issue (usually due to packaging) I had to first ""prove"" to them with photos that there was an issue.  This got old really quickly (especially since it was pointless because I could simply open up the packaging myself if I was really looking to pull a fast one on them).  I ended up having to escalate it to their senior management, but now it is less of an issue.  Also, their menu does vary/rotate, and that has been a bit frustrating for me since I've found a few meals I really like and all of a sudden they are no longer available.  Not much that can be done about this, and I understand they have to appeal to a wide range of tastes, but it is worth mentioning.Overall I would recommend them assuming the above doesn't pose any issues for you.",4,"Overall I'm happy with CookUnity, but there are a few issues that they should address (and to be fair, they seem to be addressing some of them).

The salmon dish I had was excellent, the pork bao and the rosemary chicken were good, but I will have to pass on the ribeye and creamed spinach next time around. The ribeye was tough, and the creamed spinach was pretty tasteless. All the dishes we had were under seasoned, but that is to be expected using a service like this - I can always add salt and pepper. I love that they list all ingredients and nutritional information on the site with the meals, and I love that all the meals are fresh.

One is a repeat of a spectacular dish from my first shipment, shrimp ceviche by Chef Fabiola Rivera, plus several new ones. The most exciting new one, which I ordered three of, is Pepes Bakar Bumbu Kuning (marinated branzino) by Chef Abe Moiz. This turned out as incredible as anticipated from the description and reviews. I love that there are online reviews, some with narratives as well as star ratings. The narratives add incredibly useful information in my selection decision making. So far, I am also finding everything incredibly fresh and high quality. I am a foodie and a gourmet cook of sorts so I am not easily impressed. Of the two other meal services that I have tried, one was quite good but nothing to rave about, and the other was terrible. The customer service is also friendly and way above and beyond the norm. This may also be a healthy influence on me because I make pizza from scratch with antimo caputo or le 5 stagioni napoletana flour way too often, but am considering extra CookUnity meals as a lower calorie alternative to my pizza fetish.

Meals were fresh, sealed, nothing leaking. After reading other reviews I was concerned about this, but it wasn't an issue at all. 5 stars for packaging & delivery. The bad: The quality of the meals is all over the place. The chicken curry was ridiculously salty, and the vegetables with the orange Habarnero chicken were so spicy I spit them into the trash. Some dishes are over-seasoned, others quite bland. The lamb burger was dry, and they packed it on TOP of the bun, which was flat as a pancake. Side dishes are disappointing--a couple tablespoons of veggies in a tiny cup. And all vegetables are mushy. The asparagus was a wilted mess, and they only give you 3 small pieces. One meal had maybe a 1/4 cup rice (?!) The craft burger was pretty good, but very few curly fries.I'd say the pasta dishes are your best bet (pretty hard to mess those up). We did enjoy the butternut squash lasagna, Rigatoni, and truffle mac & cheese. But nothing about these dishes screams ""award winning""--I've had similar meals from Amy's or Lean Cuisine.

5218,CookUnity,Commitment to quality and sustainability,"CookUnity has truly elevated my mealtime experience! The food quality consistently impresses me with its freshness and flavor, and this remains true even when using the microwave. Each meal, clearly labeled with packing and expiration dates for assured freshness, is never frozen and made fresh weekly. The microwaving process is quick and efficient, taking at most 3 minutes, yet it remarkably preserves the meal's quality and taste.The oven option is just as convenient, requiring only 15-17 minutes. I've found that letting the meal sit and rest for about 3 minutes after oven heating brings it to the perfect temperature for eating. This little wait time makes all the difference, ensuring every bite is just right.Admittedly, there have been a few hiccups along the way, but their customer support team is incredibly responsive. With a bit of patience and follow-up, any issue I've encountered has been efficiently resolved. The delivery service is also impressively timely, and I appreciate the various notification options available when my food is delivered.Their commitment to sustainability is another plus.

We ordered them to make it easy for her to have something good to eat while she recovers from radiation treatments. The quality is considerably below what she can cook, and in some cases what even I can cook. So far, she has tried three of the twelve initial meals. I wound up eating them to prevent waste. The meat portions were dry, and two meals were very much too salty. In one case, the vegetable side had gone bad. I'm guessing the spinach was the culprit there, typically where oil and seasoning are mixed using hands and fingers, preferably gloved.

5592,Grubhub,I'm going to break this down honestly…,I'm going to break this down honestly the right way. GrubHub is a very very excellent company. Because they're delivery and services are reasonable prices. They have great customer service that are very respectable and they truly work with you if you had a problem. And they will refund your money if necessary depending on the situation itself. So that's the reason why I like GrubHub. But one thing they should do is train their delivery people and change their policy with them that they cannot keep their delivery food of other people Sue themselves by canceling their orders not wanting to come to their door delivering door to door. Usually drivers will cancel a person's delivery just to keep it and satisfy themselves because they know they could keep it in the long run. Now if GrubHub would change that mark my word the delivery people will have no choice but to come door to door and deliver the food to the individual ordering. Delivery people take advantage of this policy which is horrible for the individuals ordering their food. Because then we never get our food at all and what happens if the restaurant is closed they cannot redo the order and we lose out. Which is not fair to us at all. So GrubHub has to step up and change this policy with their delivery people and if they do change it they will have more responsible delivery people to do the right job even better. One more thing if GrubHub does not permit restaurants to use only their workers to do the delivery. And that the restaurants they will force them to use their services without side people to take orders not only the restaurants people to have to deliver. It will be great if they do that as well because it will allow outside individuals to to grab an order and come up and deliver door to door. So yes GrubHub please change those policies and I believe I truly believe that you will have more excellence delivery drivers with better reviews of your company guaranteed. Changes sometimes are done for the best so save your company that is doing such a good job so far in my opinion. Cuz I order a lot from different companies and so far honestly your company is been number one for me and many people I recommended them to your company agrees with me as well.,5,I'm going to break this down honestly the right way.

I got an initial confirmation email but no more emails or texts after (at all, or at any time since then).  After 50 minutes I called the customer service line.  They said the food had been delivered!  That was not the case and so they said they would replace the order with special instructions to deliver within 30 minutes.  Once again, no text or email update or confirmation.  So I called again thinking they may have delivered to the wrong address again - I wanted to confirm they had the right one.  Yes, they confirmed my address, email, and phone number.  This time they said the order was done, it was waiting for a pickup.  They didn't know why I had no contact from them and they assured me they had the right address, phone number, and email.  I asked about the previous delivery, were they sure this new delivery wasn't going to the same place?  They looked at the driver's photo and said it was a picture of the highway!  But, they assured me, the replacement food would be picked up and delivered to me shortly.  40 minutes later, no text, no email, no food.  I called again and this time they said they would check with the restaurant.  They said, the place had closed for the evening.  They apologized and said I would get a full refund.  I could take a  survey after the call to let them know my disappointment.  I waited for the survey and the phone hung up instead!So now I have gone to the restaurant's website.

5680,Grubhub,Never again,"Never again. My experience with Grubhub was infuriating. My order kept getting delayed, and I ended up waiting for hours. When I contacted customer service, they initially offered me a measly $5 credit towards my next order. After persistently requesting a refund and for my order to arrive promptly, I was transferred to a supervisor named Loren M. She kept gradually increasing the credit offer up to $20–in between, stating ""$10 is our max."" During our conversation, there was a back-and-forth about a credit vs. a refund. I made it clear that I wanted a refund, not just a credit for a future order. Initially, despite my repeated requests for a refund, Loren M. Continued to insist on offering credits. She eventually stated she would issue the refund of $20, then seconds later said she sent a credit—neither of which, ever occurred. Additionally during this back and forth, she stated initially I could not cancel my order. Even though I had already told her repeatedly, I did not want my order cancelled. Loren then flips the script once again stating she's not going to issue a refund or credit, at all. While we're discussing the latest inconsistency, I get a notification that Grubhub cancelled my order. She cancelled my order, without my consent, denied even cancelling it, and when challenged with the fact I was just notified of such, she admitted it was cancelled but shifted the blame to the person I initially spoke with—her subordinate. This entire ordeal, with now no food and no delivery options open in the area at 9 pm, left me furious. It was probably the worst customer service experience I've ever encountered, especially in dealing with a supposed supervisor. I made it clear that I would escalate this matter to Grubhub's highest levels and share my experience publicly. And I will continue on in that regard until something is done.",1,"Never again.

I ordered food once and that was it. I am now in the process of contacting Better Business Bureau and a lawyer. The customer service woman told me I could not talk to anyone else it was just her and that she would not refund me for the last 9 months subscription. And once again this is why I don't shop online and don't use these applications. They are thieves. What has this world come to. Full of scams and thieves. And they can get away with it.

5897,Grubhub,Poor customer service experience,"I placed an order through GrubHub today and included a 20% tip.  My order was accepted from the restaurant but I never received it, because my order kept going through a cycle of driver reassignments.  Essentially, my order would be assigned to one driver and then after 30 minutes it would be reassigned to another one.  After my order was an hour late, from the delivery time window established when I initially placed my order, and assigned to the third driver, I reached out to the restaurant and was told that a couple of drivers had shown up to pick up my order, but it was still awaiting pickup, which didn't make sense.  I then reached out to GrubHub customer service, explained my experience and was told that the delivery driver was 20 minutes away and was within the delivery window, but they'd give me a $10 coupon.I informed the CSR that wasn't true.  My initial delivery window was one hour prior.  It was obvious that the CSR was only focused on the delivery window established for the third driver and failed to acknowledge that this was the third delivery driver that had been assigned and that my order was an hour late.  At this point, due to a failure for the CSR to address the issue, I had absolutely no faith that I would ever receive my order, so I asked for the order to be cancelled and a refund issued.  The CSR did not acknowledge my request, so I asked again.  The CSR then cancelled my order, issued a refund and a $5 coupon and immediately ended the chat.  Poor customer service and a great example of how companies lose customers to competitors, because what does GrubHub offer that I cannot get from a competitor, or in this case the restaurant directly.  I refuse to overpay to be disrespected.",1,"I placed an order through GrubHub today and included a 20% tip.

I ordered two meals from an upscale restaurant in my area. When you know you are going to be getting amazing food, you don't mind paying more for it, so $90+ for two meals (includes all fees) is reasonable. The order went through without a hitch at 7:12 p.m. and I was text messaged that the food would arrive between 7:41 and 7:51. A short while later I received a text saying there was a delay and my food would arrive between 8:08 and 8:18. A while later another text saying the order was ""on the way"" and would now arrive between 8:25 and 8:35. At 8:22 I got a text saying the food had been delivered and was on my front steps. I brought the food in and it was basically cold. My GF stuck her fork into the chicken picata and it had completely congealed and the food wanted to come out of the tray as one single block of food. The pasta in my eggplant parm was also stuck together, and if enjoy a good Eggplant Parm the way I do then you know it is virtually inedible when it's cold and the cheeses and oils have congealed and the sauce is cold and dried up. I have no idea what the problem was getting a driver, as the restaurant is only five minutes from my house, but here we sat with two inedible meals! I contacted Grub Hub by message on their FB page and got a reply almost immediately. The person at the other end was kind and understanding and very apologetic. They asked me a few questions then asked me to stay in the message window for a minute. When they came back they informed me that they had applied a credit for both meals! Every now and then Grub Hub may have problems getting a driver in a timely fashion, but they are obviously an exceptional company the puts Customer Service above profit!

UberEats out the gate was a disaster, and 3 out of 5 orders I’ve had the displeasure of being a part of have had issues. I rarely have Grubhub order issues, and if I do, before I can even get to a human who goes more than above and beyond, I already have been comped for the order. 10/10 would recommend over UberEats, and especially DoorDash after hearing about their class action lawsuit.",5,"I am genuinely shocked at all the 1-star reviews I’m seeing.

1,Just Eat,P1ss poor. Won‚Äôt attempt to use again,"Having ordered last night, I was given a delivery time between 18.25 & 18.45.As earlier time approached, I got a message saying there was a delay & would now be 18.35-18.55.Again as it went past the earlier delivery time I had another message saying between 18.45 & 19.05.  When it got to 19.20 with no further message I had to give up & cancel. By this time I was starving and had to resort to a bowl of cereal.Upon cancellation just asked why I was cancelling‚Ä¶., no attempt at an apology of any sort. Couldn‚Äôt leave review on JustEat but so annoyed has to share.",1
2,Just Eat,Compensation thieves!,"Be careful of these money stealing, no delivering jokes of a company! They promise compensation for their lack of service, but give nothing back",1
3,Just Eat,The WORST customer service,"The WORST customer service. Never received my requested refund. I have spoken with Chakali Pavan, Satish Pola, Lyndsay Hall and the team leader Hannah. They all ignored my request only offering less than 50% of my order value in CREDIT. Not a refund. CREDIT. My whole order was ruined, cold and very late. They refused to let me speak to an actual manager and then said if i keep emailing, they will close this case and I will not be able to contact them. This is a joke. I want refund of my order.",1

5,Just Eat,Disgraceful!! Late delivery,"Disgraceful!! I asked for my order to be delivered for 11:45am and yet, they took hours to even assign me a driver and then when they finally do it the says estimated for 11:56am which is an absolute disgrace when I wanted our order for 11:45am and chose it for then, to then not get it by then. I‚Äôm not happy by this at all, it‚Äôs a disgrace and I expect an apology!! Come on you had since 10:30am to confirm and assign a driver for this, yet it wasn‚Äôt done. So I am making this complaint. I‚Äôm sat here hungry for our order and so is my son. If you had done your job properly our food would have been here by now!!",1

8,Just Eat,Just Eat is terrible,"Just Eat is terrible. I ordered food to arrive at the start of my lunch break. Instead, the app told me it'd be 45 minutes late, which would make it arrive after my break was over. I tried to cancel the order but Just Eat wouldn't do anything about it.

10,Just Eat,I used to order a lot through JustEat‚Ä¶,"I used to order a lot through JustEat but from now on I believe I won't order with them anymore. 1- their ""tracking"" app is absolutely useless because it gives you an approximate time of preparation for your order. It happens MORE AND MORE that it says ""your order will be there in 39mins"" and in the end I have to wait 1:30 to 2:30 to get my order.2- when there's a problem you can contact them as much as you want, you won't have any answer. Especially if they know that you will ask for a refund. Which is VERY PROBLEMATIC when an item is missing in your order. I had tons of other problems with them, little ones at the beginning, then it happened more frequently and now it's always the case and NONE OF THEM were ever taken. Tonight I ordered at 6:30 and received my order at 20:30....",1
11,Just Eat,What a f****** crap company,"What a f****** crap company! I ordered food in Montpellier and I was waiting downstairs for the delivery guy. Saw some people riding on their bikes but had no idea one of them had my order (I cannot know that). Saw the guy on the tracker waiting 2 blocks away no movement on the tracker. After some time I recieved a mail that the guy was at my door and would wait 5 more minutes and then he would drive off, while I was waiting on my f****** doorstep and didn't see anybody!!!!! Called the number on the email and the lady said it was my fault because i did not respond to the driver's email or phone call... I DID NOT GET ANY MAIL OR CALL!!!!! Asked for a refund then told me it was not possible because I did not answer, YOUR F****** DRIVER DID NOT PUT ANY EFFORT INTO FINDING THE RIGHT PLACE!!!! Gave me a 20‚Ç¨ voucher for a f****** 30‚Ç¨ order... F*** this!",1

14,Just Eat,Just thieves and liars,"Just thieves and liarsOrdered food that never came. Since December I have been on their case to refund my money and they keep giving the same nonsense. Their apparent investigation team will get back to me in 48 hours. Never happened. As soon as I get my refund I'm closing my account. Don't put your money into Just Thieves. They genuinely don't care and intentionally make it difficult to get through to customer services, probably because of the negative calls they know they will get! Its a shame we can't give a minus rating",1

Provided proof of no orders and would not give a refund and accused me of lying and had allowed someone else to use the voucher. No food and just gave them ¬£15 that they won't refund or they have sent to someone else account by mistake. Data breach!!! don't use website as you have no idea where your details and money is being sent to!!,1
17,Just Eat,Terrible service and food never arrived,"Ordered food at 6pm. App kept updating the expected delivery time and saying it wasnt assigned to a driver. Then did get assigned around 7.30pm. We called the restaurant and they were lovely, said they have issues all the time with Just Eat and they're gonna complain too - even offered a full refund and food free of charge. Called Just Eat 3 times and have had probably worst customer service from any business ever - out of the 3 times I called, they hung up twice after I gave my order number (the same agent both times) and then the third agent helped and gave ¬£5 credit. I requested ¬£15 goodwill instead and the agent declined so I asked to speak to a manager. They ignored my request and just asked if there anything else they could do(?) I said again I wanted to speak to a manager; at that point the line went silent for 15 mins, so in the end I hung up. Eventually got through to someone on online chat (at 9pm - 3 hrs after we made the order) who repeated to me that the order was never assigned and would I like a refund. They kept using this canned response when I asked more questions. Eventually I agreed to cancel the order. My sister also spoke to someone who said we will get manager callback within 24 hours but I have no faith.",1

26,Just Eat,Rude customer service.,"Okay long story short, last night i ordered online from pizza time's a menu pizza for 39euros. In this menu i had to choose 2 pizzas and a drink. I did choose my pizzas but i couldn't choose the drink as it was only a specific one. I got a message on my phone that the order would be here at a specific time. In the website it says 30 to 45mins and i got my food after more than an hour and it was cold plus with out my drink so i decided to call and let them know. As i did call, the woman on the phone was rude, didn't let me talk so i had to raise my voice a bit so she would stop talking. At the end she made it clear that it was my fault and that they take no responsibilities which is absolutely unprofessional and that made me not want to order from them again. So all i wanted to say in this message is that when i get this kind of behavior even if it was my fault (which it wasn't), i get so upset because this is not how it should work. Where is the respect to the customers? Politeness ZERO.PS: The delivery boy came back to bring me the drink and both ways he was absolutely kind and apologized more than 3 times and it wasn't really his fault.",1

84,Hello Fresh,Worst delivery service ever,"Well let's see.  First, they cancelled my new service because the person at this address who died three years ago had used it and the address matched.  Then after nearly 45 minutes on chat, they reactivated my account with a shipping date of yesterday.  Today their website asked how I liked the recipes for the food that was delivered yesterday, that wasn't.  I waited 15 minutes for a chat agent to be told that there was an ""unspecified error"" with my order and they'd credit my account.  Which still doesn't get me my food.

He asked me if I could give the food to someone else, like I can afforded as a single parent to just give my food away üôÉ I‚Äôm sure wanting to change my meals the day after the cut of date isn‚Äôt that difficult!!! I would understand if it was so close to my delivery day. Or at least cancel the box from coming to me so I could at least use the money to buy food this week that we WILL eat.  Cancelled my subscription straight away over the phone and won‚Äôt be using hello fresh again. Awful with helping I would understand if this was a repetitive problem but this was the FIRST time using this service and mistakes happen.

When I saw that there was additional shipping added and tried to speak with a chat associate, I was basically told that I couldn't do math. They actually typed ""$6.99√ó2=$13.98"" which was referring to a meal option when my question was about the shipping price. So now I've been insulted and still didn't have the information I was looking for. I've also yet to be refunded for a canceled box. It's been an abysmal experience.",1

I would suggest an option where we send the ice packs back for a delivery discount or something.  It's such a waste to throw them away and a family can only use so many ice packs. Also, the price isn't terrible but they need to do better with maintaining discount codes and pricing. I've had many deliveries come at different prices. It's frustrating. Every now and then an item will be missing from the packages, usually not a big deal but can be inconvenient. It's happened to my family more than 5 times out of 19 boxes. At least 3 of our boxes had rotten veggies in it too. In general, the service is good. There are just a few kinks to work out to get closer to perfect.",4

I order the first box (3 meals) for $15 dollars. Still wasn't %100 percent free but I still thought it was a great deal. Then the next week I looked at my bank statement and was charged $60 dollars for another 3 meals. I called to figure out why the price had been raised so much since I had only ordered 3 meals so far and I was supposed to get 16 for free and all they told me was that I should have read the fine print and that they would not reimburse me for the second box. They have terrible customer service and are very sneaky with their advertisements. I will never be using this service again and would not recommend to anyone solely based off of their sneakiness.,1

Problem came with canceling. When you search the customer service for cancel, it tells you you can pause ""instead"". So I paused the next few deliveries. Looking further I find instructions to email them. Per instructions it said send an email, stating that you wish to terminate your account along with your full name a registered email address. I did this instead of calling as it was night and around Christmas. That apparently does nothing. As a month later I get another box, which I of course have to pay for because the cs rep said my account was just paused. Bottom line call them and wait on hold forever to cancel.",1

223,Hello Fresh,Nice recipes but major drawbacks,"Pros: The meals are easy to make and added variety to my dinners by teaching me new recipes. Cons: having complex dietary restrictions and preferences mean that I'm scrutinizing every meal option. I can never just leave the automatic selections and it takes me about 20 minutes each week to find a meal that works. I keep kosher, which means that I don't eat meat and dairy in the same meal. And my boyfriend is not a fan of many of the vegetarian options. So I'm always looking for meat meals that don't have dairy in them, or where I can swap out the dairy. Also, despite 5-6 conversations with customer support, I can never figure out how to take advantage of rewards that involve adding a free item to my order. I restarted my subscription specifically because I was tempted by the free breakfast item per box and I cannot for the life of me figure out how to add it.",3

My mother was reluctant to give out this information and this is when your customer service woman hung up on my mother. So, my mother placed a second call to your customer service and this time she was speaking with a man, and he was a lot more helpful. He informed her that she had activated her account and she would not be eligible for any refund for any orders that had been shipped. He also informed her that these three orders had been shipped to an address in Fort Wayne Indiana.

282,Hello Fresh,"Poor quality food, poor service",Hello Fresh is an expensive service. Poor communication with staff support. Items were not worth the price value. Food sickness after trying the meals and product.,2
283,Hello Fresh,"Convenient and Easy, but too much packaging",Too much packaging but overall an easy great way to avoid eating out as much. I use HF when my parents are out of town and it's just going to be me cooking for myself.,4
284,Hello Fresh,"Good food, but could use some work","The food is usually good, but doesn‚Äôt always show up in good shape. There‚Äôs variety in the meals, but most of them require using the oven (usually at 400+) unless you want to pay almost $100 a week for salads and pasta. I‚Äôve had some issues redeeming coupons on the app and it‚Äôs difficult to find purchase info. Cutting down on grocery shopping saves quite a bit of time and money, but it‚Äôs not a perfect system.",3

286,Hello Fresh,TOO MANY attempted charges if you have a payment issue,"I had an unrelated fraud charge on the card I use to pay for HelloFresh.  This caused my credit card company to put a hold on the card while they reviewed the suspicious transaction.  In the meantime while the card had a hold on it, HelloFresh's automated payment system was just bombarding my card with payments for my next shipment.  And I don't mean a few... this happened 18 times on the first day, 11 times on the next day, and so on.  HelloFresh's automated payment routine has no chill and further flagged my already on-hold credit card account.  The actual food and recipes HF offers are fine.  But these payment practices are very heinous.",2

291,Hello Fresh,Disappointing to say the least.,I was missing one complete meal and the protein from another. The chives and cilantro were wilted and mushy.

I really couldn't be connected with the person who had just literally called me? My discount was for free shipping, but the agent claimed it was only for the first box. I have an email with a pricing schedule of $30 for the first box, followed by $50 per week. According to the agent, the free shipping was for the first box only. I'm being charged $70 per week, but the email says that will be the recurring charge AFTER the discount period ends. I was charged $70 from the second week onward.

The part i dont like is that you can do NOTHING I MEAN NOTHING to change ANYTHING if you accidentally miss the 5 day window of skip the meal or edit your meal. i understand they need time to prepare the kit BUT is it that difficult to create a text notification or reminder function? I was very angry about this because my Dec 31st box delivery was delayed because they say the courier damaged the box so they have to send out a new box. The new box arrived on Jan 3rd. I've been sick for a week and only remembered i had a box on the way so forgot to skip the Jan 7th box. AND the Jan 7th box arrived on Jan 6th, which was one day earlier. Imagine a broke family with a tiny fridge and so many hellofresh meal kits. And i did contact the customer support immediately after received the msg from my bank account and explained my situation and it's already too late and nothing can be done by anyone anyway. They gave me a 30 buck around credit which can only be used on non-discount deliveries, aka deliveries with original price that i cant afford. Poor people dilemma, i guess it's a boo to myself.",3

So I am very thankful for Hello Fresh and the meals. This time around we've been using it for about 3 months and have not had one meal that was bad. All have been good.

431,Hello Fresh,The Jury is Still Out,"On the positive side, it takes the guess work out of what are we going to have for dinner tonight. The meals are tasty and certainly convenient as almost everything needed for meal preparation is included in the kit.On the negative side, the meals are too pricey. Many could be obtained for half the cost, let alone adding the cost of shipping. The quality of the vegetables is sometimes questionable - particularly the broccoli. The preparation estimates are off by at least half. In some instances, this could be improved by supplying 2 or 3 large potatoes instead of 9 or 10 small potatoes - thus saving paring time. The portion sizes are inconsistent. Sometimes I feel satisfied and other times I am left hungry. One needs an accounting degree to figure out what one is getting charged for their meals and whether or not they have gotten all the promotions or discounts they have been promised. The service reminds me of the Scholastic Book Club when I was a kid in that if you failed to act, a book was on the way. This should be an opt in service, not the other way around. If one forgets the change day, you are stuck with what they want to send you. And, heaven forbid you want to cancel a week after your change date - even if you miss it by one day. I find that their customer service is a mixed bag. They seem eager to provide a credit when something is not to the customer's liking, but in a recent chat session, the respondent's grammar and spelling were atrocious.",3

Another charge came through for $90 that HF is now refusing to refund even though I am still in contact with the Food Safety team. Predatory!

516,Hello Fresh,3+ Year Member Using a Gift Card,"I've been a customer for three-plus years. I ordered over 180 meals in 2022 and over 180 in 2023. Amazing meals. Delivered on time exactly to my door exactly as promised. I received an online gift card for Christmas this year. I went to the gift card section of the website. I went to redeem the gift card. My gift card had a ""gift card#"" and a ""pin#."" The website didn't ask for either of those. It asked for ""code"". Knowing what I know from other websites (particularly movie theater websites), I type in the card number, press submit, type the pin, press submit. I assumed I would enter the card number first. It didn't allow for 20 numbers of the card number. While I probably should have tried the pin# after that, I didn't. Instead, I tried to use their own help chat. It kept asking me to login and redirected me. I was already logged in, as I always am. I went back to chat, and the same prompt appeared.Already frustrated, I called the help number. I was connected right away with an agent. I won't use his name. He told me that I use the pin number. I get it, but I asked him why the gift card had ""card number"" and ""pin number,"" but the website says ""enter code."" and never says anything about ""card number"" and ""pin number."" He told me, ""It's common sense, sir."" I was in disbelief at how disrespectful that comment was. I asked if I could speak to his manager. He said, ""Sure. A manager will call you back within 24-48 hours."" I'm not entirely sure why I couldn't talk to a manager at that moment.There are many other meal prep delivery companies out there. I used Blue Apron for maybe two years. I've used Hello Fresh since August 10, 2020. I think they are amazing and I don't plan to switch. Had I been prompted to write a review about this company as a whole, it would have been favorable. But I'm being prompted with my most recent experience.This particular incident certainly isn't enough for me to switch, but the frustration I already felt, plus what I felt to be a disrespectful response, was enough to write a review about this incident.Updated 1/7/24I never did get the phone call that the customer service representative (CSR) said would be coming within 24-48 hours. I did get an email from the customer service department, apologizing for the CSR's insensitive comment. It was mentioned that I could edit my Trust Pilot review and rating, something which I'm uncomfortable doing. Hello Fresh is a great company. I've given them over $7500 for their amazing meals and delivery service. I may do a general review, stating as much. It does not change this experience. I would have appreciated the promised phone call (I do not desire it now). I think a $50 credit towards my next box would have been an appropriate remedy, to keep me a satisfied customer.",1

While there are certainly some positive aspects, there are also a few drawbacks that can't be overlooked.Let's start with the positives. The convenience of having pre-portioned ingredients delivered to my door is a time-saver, and the variety of recipes offered is commendable. The step-by-step instructions are generally easy to follow, making it accessible for cooks of all skill levels. The freshness of the ingredients is noticeable, and I appreciate the effort HelloFresh puts into sourcing quality produce.However, there are a few aspects that left me somewhat disappointed. Firstly, the cost. While the convenience is undeniable, the price tag is a bit steep compared to traditional grocery shopping. It's essential to weigh the added cost against the time saved and the convenience offered.Another concern is the occasional lack of variety in meal choices. Although HelloFresh promotes diverse menus, I found that some weeks had limited options, and the rotation of recipes seemed a bit repetitive. This may be a subjective experience, but it's worth noting for those seeking a consistently fresh culinary experience.One aspect that needs improvement is the packaging. While I understand the necessity of keeping ingredients fresh, the amount of packaging involved feels excessive and contributes to environmental concerns. It would be great to see HelloFresh explore more sustainable packaging options.In summary, HelloFresh offers convenience and quality, but the cost, limited variety, packaging, and customer service could use some refinement. It's a service with its merits, but potential subscribers should carefully consider their priorities and preferences before committing.",4

I reported it and was given a credit toward a future box where there was no discount given.  The product arrived unusable and no refunds are given.  It's not good, refunds should be given so you can go buy the product at the store.  This week my pork chops were leaking.  It's every week.Pricing is not very transparent either.

On top of that, I didn‚Äôt even choose the meals that came in that box. Since I was out of town, I had a friend come get it, but the delivery driver failed to follow instructions and put the box inside my building, making it very difficult for my friend to retrieve the box. When I called hello fresh for some assistance, the best they could do was a $9 credit, as if that‚Äôs anywhere close to the amount I paid for the box. Ridiculously terrible service",1

The preparation took on an even, steady rythm from one meal to the next, so no surprises.  The meals tend to go a little heavy on the salt recommendations, but you can control that yourself.

Plus both my partner and his daughter appreciate step-by-step instructions as they learn that cooking healthy foods with produce and flavor doesn't have to be complicated. There is plenty of variety, so if you don't like any specific recipe or ingredient you can just select something else. I also LOVE the market place items.

687,Hello Fresh,Bad quality & customer service,"We started doing hello fresh this past summer after having our first baby to make things easier on us. The quality of the produce and meat had never been great, but we dealt with it because it was usually still edible (outside of a few instances) and it was convenient. However the last few boxes we had received had grown increasingly worse. Old squishy garlic cloves, spotted/moldy green beans, moldy potatoes, rotten broccoli to name just a few. The final straw for us was biting into pork tacos made with ground pork, and discovering multiple pieces of bone. My husband bit into a piece of bone larger than a pea. When we contacted the company they asked if I was still able to make a meal without the pork (‚Ä¶the meal was pork tacos, so no‚Ä¶). they claimed to be so sorry and were going to make it right by issuing a refund, only to refund me $3. Yes THREE dollars. What a joke, will not be giving them business in the future.",1

Out of about 3 months worth of once a week meals sent to my house, 2 times I had a problem. I don't like that, as I think that's too often to have a problem. One time the contents were all over the place and one time they forgot the chicken. The first time I complained and I got a free dinner I think. The second time I didn't even bother, I had chicken breasts. I am doing this to get a handle on cooking. I have never cooked anything really, always eating out or x wives did the cooking. I think soon I'll stop the deliveries and cook the meals from scratch myself. For me this was a great way to start to learn to cook.",4

Hello Fresh has changed my life and I plan on continuing with the subscription; however, I feel like a lot of people ""scam"" the system.

767,Hello Fresh,Not so Fresh,"The limited diversity in HelloFresh's meal selections diminishes the overall culinary experience, leaving customers wanting more adventurous options. The billing practices add frustration, as users are unexpectedly charged, and canceling becomes an intricate process.

I honestly don‚Äôt believe the algorithm exists and your pre-chosen meals are based on what is in stock. No items have expiration dates.Money is their main focus and they will pester you with massive amounts of e-mails to give free boxes to others. It‚Äôs annoying. Customer service and communication is horrible. They refuse to send any notifications regarding costs or meals to subscribers. When I left, they made it perfectly clear they didn‚Äôt care about that. Nobody even asked if there was an issue. My one e-mail about why I canceled was completely ignored. I‚Äôm currently looking for a better service.

Unfortunately, most all the meals are beginning to taste the same.  I find their ""discounts/rewards"" are a bit confusing so haven't redeemed them yet, but most annoying is their constant barrage of emails.  Initially, I felt their pricing was a bit on the high side, but after a couple months now, I realize I'm spending less on groceries since I'm not having to go to the store  so often and therefore am not purchasing products I end up throwing away and my fridge stays a lot cleaner.",3

After 2 years I‚Äôve tried pretty much all of them. I love that there is no commitment and you can skip weeks whenever you need to. I save my recipe cards so that I can remake the recipes. I do wish that they would sell their spice blends although I have found where you can google the blend and duplicate it. Hello Fresh has made me a better cook and it‚Äôs definitely gotten me out of the ‚Äúwhat am I going to make tonight‚Äù rut that I was in. Update: just received my box and no recipe card in it!

899,Hello Fresh,Hello Fresh = Scammers,"Hello Fresh sent me a 50% coupon to use if I ""unskipped"" getting meals that week. I went online to use the coupon and spent time choosing the meals. When I went to check out, the coupon wouldn't work. I went on their ""Chat"" 7 different times, trying to find out why the coupon wasn't working. Each time on chat, an agent assured me the coupon would work. It never worked. Finally, I was so annoyed that I went on chat again (their phone service was not available) and stated that I wanted the agent to assure me that I would not be sent or charged for any meals since the coupon didn't work. The agent told me that my order was cancelled, and I would not receive any meals. I snapped pictures of our chat conversation because I didn't trust what I was being told. A few days later I received a box of 3 meals (meals I would never choose). HELLO FRESH CHARGED ME FULL PRICE FOR THE MEALS.  I immediately called their customer service to get a refund and I was treated very rudely and told I could not get a refund. I called them again and the same thing happened. Worst customer service I've ever dealt with!!! I'm sure the response from HF will be that they don't want their customers to have a bad experience. So WHY did I have it? I went on chat 8 times and called twice and no one helped me. Does that sound like they train their agents to actually help customers? Their bogus coupon didn't work. They assured me I would NOT get a box of meals or be charged for it, but I did receive the meals and was charged full price. HF had opportunities to refund the charges, but instead of doing that, I had nasty customer service people who were rude. I cancelled my membership and will NEVER subscribe again. THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT I WAS SCAMMED! None of this should have happened. When it did happen, the company should have remedied it immediately. An honest, reputable company does that.

920,Hello Fresh,Meat package leaked,"The only real problem was the meat pkg. was leaking!As I was putting the bags and meat into the refrigerator I noticed my hands getting wet but thought it was from the freezer pack.  I then noticed how sticky my hands were and there were meat juice spots on the floor that led to the refrigerator.  I then rinsed off all of the meat packages and put them into their own ziplok baggies.  That evening and the next day(this morning), the refrigerator had a strange smell.  I finally took all the ingredients out of the paper bags (because I feel the meat juice leaked onto the paper bags) and into their own Bowls or plastic bags and put them back into the refrigerator.I cannot wait to make one of the meals tonight!  I am sure it will be delicious!Thank You",3

The delivery company they use seem like they have random people driving for them. I have ordered at 13 times at my location and there seems to be a problem at least once a month.

924,Hello Fresh,"Great food recipes, healthy, but a little costly","I really enjoyed HelloFresh. Nice service (they deliver the food in insulated boxes), it arrived on time every week on the same day). The food was delicious and fresh and the recipe card was very clear and had pictures for each step in the cooking process. There was a nice variety of entrees so you were never bored.The only drawback was the cost and meal box size. You could only get 2 or 4 servings per meal (and 2 meals per box). I got 4 servings per meal but have a family of 6, so I ended up having to buy extra ingredients each week. The cost was around $70 per week (not including the extra cost of ingredients). I felt like I could buy the ingredients for $15-20 cheaper. However, with the meal card, shipping straight to your house, fresh food, and not needing to choose what I‚Äôm going to make each week, it offset the cost somewhat.I ended up canceling the subscription in the end, because of the price only. It just didn‚Äôt work out for a family of 6. Would recommend for a single person, 2, or 4 though.",4

1013,Hello Fresh,Average product but crazy money grabbing,"I used HelloFresh for a few months in 2021, but ultimately found that there weren't enough recipes that I liked, and it didn't actually save me any time, effort, or money.I still get 4-5 emails a week from them, and usually I just delete them. This week I decided to click on one email, just to see if it might be worth trying again. I clicked a button in the email to go to the website, then decided it was the same and exited.I didn't find out until today that I was billed $55 and I'm already past the point of being able to cancel the order. Of course, all the recipes coming are not appealing to me at all, and I clicked ONE button on the website! At NO point did I click ""reactivate"" or ""place order."" I'm a business owner and pretty savvy online... it's not like I don't know how to follow online instructions.Plus, I haven't gotten a box in OVER TWO YEARS! For them to still have access to my payment account and automatically bill me that easily is unsettling.I felt neutral about this product before... now I officially have lost all trust in them because just clicking on an email ended up costing me $55! I contacted customer support and eventually got a partial refund, but it took a lot of effort.They also said it will take 10 days to delete my payment information from the account. That seems like a long time to just... remove my payment method. I've never had an experience like this with any other company, but I do not trust them or recommend them at all.",2

1086,Factor_,My Factor Experience,"I really liked what Factor was trying to do here. I enjoyed being able to come home from one of my three super late shifts and not have to worry about cooking. Not only that, but it was healthier options than I used to have. So what happened? For me it ended up not working out because me and my S.O just don't make enough money to pay our bills, get groceries and get factor. For us to have just 3 meals each, which covered those hard days so I tried it, it was roughly $98 a week(after our promotional discounts). That's over $400 extra a month for us. We just can't afford that in our budget. The other problem was a bit smaller. We weren't satisfied with every meal. Some of them tasted great, and some of them were boring and left us wanting more (snacking). The protein shakes were delicious too but for 6 protein shakes, it was $30 extra. Now. At the grocery store they have an identical protein shake called Koia, tastes exactly the same. I would be saving money getting the exact same amount from them, especially if there's a sale which happens often enough. I would love to try Factor again if it was either more affordable or if I somehow manage to start making more money. Worth a shot, didn't work out for us but it might work out for you, especially if you're single so you don't have to get as many meals.",3
1087,Factor_,I am happy with the food,"I am happy with the food, but I‚Äôm most happy with the portion size. I am not hungry after eating, usually full.

Still, they assured me the box had been shipped and blamed the issue on UPS.It is now Thursday 1/18/24 and we still have not received our shipment and there are no changes to the statuses on their site or UPS. I contacted customer support again and they assured my it would be still be delivered by 8pm. I didn't believe the agent via chat, so I called customer service instead.I waited for 30 min to talk to someone and they immediately hung up on me. I called back and waited another 30 min. They told me ""they can see something that I can't"" and my shipment would still be delivered by 8pm tonight. I called UPS and they told me either the box was never shipped or it was lost in transit because it was never scanned.I spent 3 hours on the phone between Factor and UPS and my family spent a couple hours selecting meals for the next few weeks. We didn't purchase any other groceries for the week because we were expecting this delivery, so we didn't have anything in the house for dinner for the past 2 nights.This company is dishonest and has AWFUL customer service.

I was scheduled to receive a Factor order on January 10th. It never arrived. At the time, the Factor app indicated this order was delivered. This was incorrect.  The following day I received notification via email that in fact the box had been lost. Ok, fine. Unforeseen circumstances can occur. I called Factor customer service on January 11th to inquire why the app was showing the box was delivered, when it was not. The women I spoke with was very nice, but I was unable to fully understand her. I also followed up with an email requesting clarification and Ms.      responded with a very clear and helpful response. I was told the cost of the box which I already paid for would be credited to future orders that I had not already have a discount applied to it. This is completely unacceptable! I have now paid for 3 boxes. January 3rd arrived and was great. On January 10th I was informed would be short a meal due to a shortage of ingredients and a $5 credit would be applied to a future box. The box never came. Box #3 that just arrived today. It was short another meal due to shortage of ingredient. An email from Factor75 indicates a $5 voucher to be applied to next box, and hence my refund for box #2 which I paid for and which was not my error extends out further.  I am retired on a fixed income, and this is just so wrong. Bad business! I expect a refund of $83.66 which is the amount Factor75 holds for future boxes in full and promptly.Factor75 has conducted these business transactions in such a poor and unacceptable manner, I can only conclude that Factor75 is a scam. Your customer service amounts to forcing customers to accept it‚Äôs product with small, incremental discounts to future ‚Äúboxes‚Äù as a repayment of my money.Jeanette L.  Hoblitzell",1
1131,Factor_,Delicious fresh meals,"Delicious fresh meals.  The quality and selection is wonderful.  I would give 5 stars if not for the following two things:1 - The amount of meals required to purchase each week is too much for me, as I live alone and I also enjoy preparing my own meals often.  It would be nice to be able to order just one or two meals as needed rather than every week.2 - Often the portions are too large for me to eat at a single meal so I end up throwing a lot away.",4

1134,Factor_,"Good food, but deliveries not ready for primetime!","My Factor journey started on 2023-12-02 when I signed up for an 18-meal plan. My intent was to entirely replace my daily meals with Factor. My shipment was scheduled to arrive in 10 days on 2023-12-12. This was perfect, since I was traveling on 2023-12-13 and planned to take the box of meals with me to use on my 6 day trip. On 2023-12-12 I called four times that day, looking for a delivery status on my box, since I was flying out early the next morning. On my last call after 8:00 pm local, I was informed that the box would be delivered tomorrow and that there was no way to stop or reschedule now. I got very frustrated, since Factor had me planning for 10 days and canceled my membership. When I returned from my trip, my box was still sitting outside my door. I did open it and looked at the food that looked very good. I threw the entire box away (loosing $117.59) and then called Factor back to try this again. I now had to wait for another shipment that actually arrived on time and thoroughly enjoyed the meals. That box only cost me $54.09. Factor obviously came out ahead. The third box, costing $202.26 for 18 meals, came on-time and things were progressing nicely. I was finding meals I liked and changed my meal count to 16 and prioritized healthy meals I really enjoyed eating. Then things went array. My next order that was supposed to arrive on 2024-01-09 never arrived. I called support, knowing that these shipments can be late, and patiently waited 24 hours. Next day, same thing. No box. In fact, the box never arrived. No emails, no communication, nothing... unless I called support complaining. Annoyingly I was given a ""credit"" for my box that never arrived, only to have Factor charge me immediately for a future shipment. Then why give me a ""credit"" at all. Now I wait another week, normal delivery, again great meals... and let me say, I have absolutely NO Complaints about the food! This is the most frustrating part. Another week passes and AGAIN they hit me with another subscription payment for 16 meals without subtracting from the credit! I'm now very frustrated and called support again to ask why and was told that I can ONLY use the credit after my promotional period ends. What? If you make a mistake, I do I have to keep paying for it?In short, the food is well above average, and some meals are exceptional, in my opinion. I wish this ""ready to eat"" meal delivery service was more of a ""service"" in lieu of a money-making subscription. I felt bad calling customer support, since I was talking to people who are obviously working from home (dogs barking in the background) and can't do anything to address my problems. At one point I was given a $201 credit in my account AND a $12.85 credit back on my credit card. However at no point did anyone from Factor reach out to me via telephone or email to explain the $12.85 refund and why I have to keep spending money each week to finally be able to use my $201 credit for mistakes they keep making.I am very disappointed to be canceling my subscription, however that is all they see this ""service"" as, is a subscription and not a meal replacement service for those of us who are busy and would prefer pre-made meals. The week my box never arrived, I had to go out and shop and find alternative meals, which is what I was trying to avoid. Let's be honest, the food I had delivered was far healthier than what I eat when left to my own options, which is why I was paying for the deliveries in the first place.I tried numerous times to work this out with Factor, however they are more concerned with their customers making weekly payments, then they are with making food deliveries, keeping their customers on a schedule, or overall customer satisfaction. I'm sorry to rate the company on my overall experience, but this is my opinion. Now that my account is canceled, my $201 credit is available to use. Thanks! Why couldn't you just do that in the first place!In Summary: ""Good food, but deliveries not ready for primetime!""",3
1135,Factor_,Only rating a 1 star because I can't‚Ä¶,"Only rating a 1 star because I can't rate them 0. I have not even received my first set of meals and I'm already cancelling my service. I have a real raw nerve for getting charged monies for something I didn't authorize. I was billed what my menu plan total was ($73.44) and then also billed ($28.97) after I had authorized the original ($73.44). I had no idea I was subjected to this charge, I received no documentation or explanation for what these charges are for. After calling them and waiting on extended hold, it was explained that some of the meal choices I made were considered ""premium meals"" and that they carried additional fees. Nowhere in my original menu decisions and adding them to my invoice did it mention this anywhere. I was invoiced and then invoiced again without my knowledge or consent. I run a retail business and I think it's fundamentally wrong to charge someone for something without their knowledge or consent.  I feel it borders on deceptive trade practice. Please understand, I can afford it, it's the principle of it that I have a problem with. Very poor customer service and long hold times when you are already upset only exacerbates the problem. I asked for a full refund which they gladly gave, but what I would've preferred is some understanding of how it feels on this side of the transaction and there seemed to be no empathy or care expressed by the company during my interaction with them.",1
1136,Factor_,Great service but some glitches in shipping,"Food is good tasting and healthy.  So far I was shorted meals two times. Once shorted one meal, second time I was shorted two meals (got four only). The first time, the website allowed me to get credit.  I knew what meal was missing because I ordered them. The second time I was asked what meal(s) was missing and was a problem because I didn't know. I had allowed Factor to choose. I could not find it on the website (it's probably there but I couldn't find it.) I got busy and could not get back to it. so I missed out on two meals I paid for.

Some people might like that but I do not, how meat is cooked should be stated on the package so if it‚Äôs rare say it‚Äôs rare so people know what they are getting. Some meals have very little vegetables, some have a lot so I think consistency in vegetable portions should be fixed. I give the flavor of the food a 5 but portion sizes a 4.

It's been about 3 weeks, 6 meals per week, and so far I have loved about 3 or 4 of the 18 I've tried. I've thrown out 2 after a few bites because of overwhelming garlic.

As of today, I've extended my baking time to 15 minutes, AND covering the cooking dish with foil, and I still had to give it 30 seconds in the microwave to warm it completely. 4 minutes is highly unrealistic.2.

That is because there is very little variety in vegetables.  Also, much of the meat is ground which I try to avoid.   I would also like to see more seafood variety.  I have tried other companies that do better with variety but they then tend to have more difficult cooking methods.    I got a really good discount to reactivate my account but was disappointed to see the same food options as choices from last year.   I will check back in the future and hope for better.

Things are pretty inexpensive and they certainly could give you more of them, in fact all of their advertising leads you to believw these are packed to the rim with veggies but I hardly get any! Keep inijd you will also need to season these yourself, I keep a handful of spices in my lunch bag because these are often bland but I get it since they are cooking for a large batch of people.

My experience with Factor has been mostly great so far. The portions are more than adequate and the food is amazing. I was super surprised to find that it comes out of the microwave as if it came right out of the oven or off the stove. I've enjoyed immensely almost every meal I've had so far (if I could give the Fiesta Salmon 6 stars, I would). The different menus every week give more than an adequate amount of options, and I've only chosen from the Protein Plus plan so far. I'm excited to try the other plans, considering what I've had so far. The amount of packaging is a bit annoying, but it's all recyclable and in the service of keeping the food fresh, so I can deal with it. The website can use a little work (it's not intuitive where to find some things), but on the whole, this is a great service, my favorite so far of the several I've tried.",4

1421,Factor_,"Good food, if it arrives.","The good:  the meals I have received thus far have almost all been very tasty and convenient.  The few that I have not liked were a matter of personal taste - the ingredients still seemed to be good quality.The bad:  This past week I received my third box of Factor on the 10 meals/week plan.  All three boxes have been missing meals.  The first week was missing 1/10, the second week was 2/10, and most recently 3/10.  For those keeping track, that's 20% of the meals I've ordered that haven't arrived.  I can understand the missing meals week 2, because there was a recall.  Week 1 and Week 2, the explanation I got from customer service was ""Supplier issues"".The mediocre: Each time I've dealt with customer service they have been quick to issue refunds/credits.  Final conclusion:  Factor meals seem to be well-prepared and they're exceptionally convenient for someone with a busy schedule like mine.  That said, a 20% miss rate when it comes to meal delivery is absolutely unacceptable and I can't justify sticking with the service.UPDATE 1/17/24:  So I got notified last night that due to supplier issues, my box that will be delivered today (1/17/24) will again be missing a meal.  But that's even less relevant because, for the second week in a row, my box won't be delivered on Wednesday.  Last week I could understand that it was weather related but that doesn't seem to be the case this week.  That's the final straw for me.",1

I appreciate a company that makes things right.  My box was discounted to get me to come back. I ordered 6 meals and only 3 came.

It‚Äôs great you offer a ‚Äúskip a week‚Äù option but, then I have to be diligent about remembering and returning to skip each week I do not want to receive meals.  I would prefer a ‚Äúon demand‚Äù delivery frequency choice.There are several reasons why I cannot always take delivery every week - travel, work, diet restrictions, health, etc. So, while I understand your preferred marketing strategy is to keep the customer engaged, the required attention is the first reason I am inclined to cancel.

Just a note I ordered the garlic mushroom chicken size this week, and they were absolutely disgusting and had to be thrown out. Chicken thighs was in nasty bits. They were rubbery, and had a lot of gristle and just was nasty. The green beans were flavorless and tough.

The online process of choosing the meals is very easy to understand and complete. I do have a suggestion, I would like to see the green beans cut in size, they are a bit messy to eat in their present long state.  Also, I would like to see glazed carrots and beets and some other kinds of veggies offered.  I seem to get broccoli an green beans too many times in a week.

I understand this being done from the company's perspective as it keeps costs & waste manageable. I appreciate that you can modify up to 4 days before your delivery date. Other meal services are 7-10. Which can be a hassle. Sometimes you want to try a meal before ordering it again. You are paying for the convenience of a heat & eat product. If you can swing it, definitely worth the investment.",4

They offered me a credit to be applied after my discounts were complete‚Ä¶THREE boxes later!  I insisted that was unfair and they refunded the cost.

I then received an email after already eating chicken that said not to eat due to it being undercooked. I had already had stomach issues to include diarrhea. The second box was short 3-4 meals due to the chicken issue. The meals overall are very high in sodium and fat even when choosing the lower fat items. Professionally I work as a Dietitian and was disappointed in the fat and sodium content. I never had issues with delivery they were always on time. The packaging did not keep the meals as cold as they should have been. I also received a damaged meal that leaked throughout the box. There is definitely room for improvement especially related to pricing of the meals, food safety, sodium and fat content, and shipping cost",3

1511,Factor_,"Factor Menu? Yawnnn, No Thanks =(","I switched from CookUnity over to Factor to give them a try since I consistently experienced shipping issues with my meals with CookUnity. (Ie. CookUnity meals frequently arrived to me unsealed, and thus not edible). It was refreshing to see that Factor's shipping and packing process is 100% better than CookUnity's, meaning I've not had one issue with my meal deliveries. I think it's because they don't use over-sized boxes leaving extra room in their shipping boxes. I digress though.My complaint with Factor is that after a couple of months I don't actually want to eat the foods that Factor offers. Their menu is tres BORING! No flavors, no diversity in their cuisine, just very typical and bland ""American"" food like chicken breast and green beans. Everything seemed to be offered with green beans... I come from an Asian American background and appreciate cuisines from different cultures and really want and need more flavors!Pros: Shipping without any issues. Meals arrived safely to me, as opposed to competitor service.I liked the larger sized portions, again compared to CookUnity. But what good is it when you just don't really love the food, right?I could only use this service short-term unless they were to start expanding their menu and cuisine.I was not impressed! =(That is my main complaint, but it's honestly an important one. No other issues aside from a limited and dull menu. I found myself tossing the meals after eating half, or sometimes less than that. It just wasn't appetizing enough. Very bummed about this.",2
1512,Factor_,Meals sucked,,1
1513,Factor_,"Food is good, but needs some improvements","I'll start by saying the food is really good and we love how convenient it is. But there are a number of things that could be improved. Would love it if you could be more specific about diet preferences. My husband is keto and I'm not. My body actually does not handle keto foods well. Every week defaults to all keto, so I try to go in and manual choose my meals. But sometimes I forget and then we're stuck with extra meals I can't eat. Would be great if we could just choose a half keto/half whatever else option so I don't have to change it each time. Another thing is the period for changing meals is very inconvenient. The deadline is 6 days before each box. It's hard to remember a week in advance (hello fresh gives you until 2 or 3 days before you get your box), and the app has not been sending me reminder notifications for that deadline. I've decided to just set a reminder on my phone calendar, but that should be better implemented to the app itself. Lastly, there should be more variety in the default selections. Each week our preselected meals typically only include about 5 different meals, with 2 or 3 servings each. If this was for one person, no one would want to eat the same meals 3 times even in 2 weeks. And typically, it'll cycle through the same meals per box, even though I can see new meals being added to the overall menu. Why not include those new meals whenever they're added? We end up changing all our meals manually each week, because otherwise I can't eat them and it's boring for my husband. I don't think these would be difficult things to implement, however, this last week's box, I manually changed almost every meal, and we only received 7 of our 14 meals (2 of mine and 5 of my husband's). I don't know how you can miss half the box when our subscription is clearly for 14 meals, but there was no notice of the change. Thankfully, when we contacted support about the problem they refunded us for the missing meals, but it still left us short on food (especially me), negating the convenience. If these things were improved, I'd consider this an awesome service, but as it is right now it's just decent enough.",3

1519,Factor_,Order was never shipped,"I was charged for food and it was never shipped. The app stated that a shipping label was generated, but nothing was ever shipped. I had to spend time negotiating with two different customer service reps before I got a refund. One rep kept assuring me that he‚Äôd contacted the delivery driver and that the driver would be contacting me (never happened) and that the delivery would be happening the night after it was supposed to arrive. The second rep confirmed that it had never even been shipped. By the time this got sorted I‚Äôd already been charged for my next box, so I guess we‚Äôll find out if I ever receive anything this time.",1

1529,Factor_,I was very loyal to this company,"I was very loyal to this company, I ended up ordering just shy of 100 boxes over my time with them.  I also got my friends and co workers to sign up.  I started off with 12 meals, which was fine.  Then I started to notice that the meals would be broken upon arrival.  I decided to let this go the first couple times.  Then I noticed I began getting fewer meals in my boxes than I was paying for.  I got automatic refunds, although I don't believe the refunds that I got matched the amount that I was paying for each meal overall.  I then went down to 10 meals a week because I wasn't getting all 12 meals anyway.  Surprise!  I got less than 10 meals each week.  I went down to 8 meals, and this week was the final straw.  I got 4 meals when I had ordered 8.  The company said I got 6.  Pretty sure I can physically count 4 boxes.  I didn't get a refund at all.  Chat takes too long to connect to, and they leave the cancellation option out of the phone app and force you to log on to the website to deactivate your plan.  What a joke.",1
1530,Factor_,They CANNOT Deliver What They Promise,"After a month and a half of using Factor, I'm warning people to stay away. The food ranges from ""fine"" to ""pretty good"", but taste is NOT Factor's problem.My 3rd week with Factor had a recall on multiple chicken meals due to undercooked chicken, several of which were in my meal box. The recall email went out FOUR DAYS after my box had arrived, so I was already eating those meals.Contacted customer service and had to push back to receive an adequate credit for being fed potentially contaminated food, but the person who helped me was kind and competent, so I chose to give Factor another chance. Plus, it was early in using Factor, so maybe this was a fluke.Only two weeks later, my Factor box arrives and it's missing several items. ONE THIRD of my weekly meals aren't there. Customer service had no answers as to what happened and simply offered credit. Credit means nothing if the product doesn't arrive in the first place or arrives contaminated. It also totally defeats the purpose of saving time with prepared meals when I have to run to the grocery store mid-week and start to toss meals together because the company I ordered from dropped the ball.Additionally: out of 5 boxes with Factor, I only had ONE delivered on the correct day. There was a one-day delay on every single other box- a full day difference matters when planning meals and groceries for the week. Get ready to see the subject line ""An Update Regarding Your Factor Delivery"" every week, because it will never go as they claim it will.",1

I was issued a credit (instead of a refund) for some of the earlier issues and will likely cancel once I use that credit up. I had a number of co-workers interested in Factor and I luckily talked them out of it before they had to experience this. It's really a shame because the meals are rather tasty, but you just absolutely cannot rely on their service whatsoever.",1

Getting the meals has been the issue though. Some come a day later, which is okay, but in every box, I've had at least one package busted open. For my most recent box, it's two days after my selected delivery date and it's not here. I understand packages arrive late, it's just concerning because my coworker has the same issue. She told me Factor is a reliable and healthy option for meals, but so far only half of that statement is true.

Of course, it was overcooked.The 2nd week we received a notice that some of the chicken meals may be contaminated and had to be thrown out. We received money back but that does not help my parents.The 3rd week we received an email stating the package had been damaged during delivery, so they are not going to receive any meals this week. Again, we got a refund but that does not help my parents.Needless to say, I fully expect a problem for the 4th and 5th week, but maybe things will change. The meals that they have received and were safe to eat have been okay. Otherwise, I would be giving this service one star.

While customer service credited me right away, the fact that I've had missing meals in 3 of my 5 boxes is a problem.

You also can‚Äôt have saved settings on types of foods you can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt eat such as seafood, pork, etc. They are only getting 2 stars because the meals at least tasted good, but I‚Äôd probably rate them a 1.5 star rating.

I kept telling app I was having difficulty and asked it to verify email and resend and still have not received 1 email.Today my 1st box showed up. I ordered 6 meals for the week as I am a busy professional. 2 of the meals were premium and I paid extra for them. The app shows the box was delivered and then showed what items were in the box.  I was shorted 4 meals, 2 of which were the premium meals. Now I have only 2 meals for the rest of a very busy week where I had not planned on cooking! I called customer service. Waited 20 minutes on hold, only to be told that I would not receive the 4 meals because the way the company works is, its too late to give me my meals as shipments already went out. What a crock! I was offered a credit to go towards next week, but after speaking with a very nice, but very difficult to understand, and inexperienced agent, I decided to cancel.  Then she told me it would take 10-12 business days to get my refund! Ridiculous.  They charged me as soon as I signed up.If there quality control for packing a box is this bad, I can only imagine how their food handling is. I have not tasted either of the 2 meals I did receive today, but I can tell you that neither look like the picture on the box. The chicken breast dinner I received may be a chicken breast but it is diced up and not a chicken breast intact. Ridiculous.  Hello Fresh bought this company for 277 million dollars.

We do prefer our veggies cooked a bit more, so we like to microwave the meals for 3 minutes, rather than the two minutes suggested by Factor.",5
1660,Factor_,Great all around!,"Deliveries are made on time, and the quality and general taste of the food is some of the best that I've had from meal delivery service like Factor. The variety and choices a great so I don't feel bored. And most importantly it's gotten me through a rough holiday season.",5
1661,Factor_,Excellent quality and taste,,5
1662,Factor_,Love the experience so far,"Love the experience so far. I have only had one meal that I hated. Not their fault, I just didn't like it. I am on my 4th box now.",5

1664,Factor_,Need greater variety,Need more choices and greater variety.  Too many things with shredded meats.  Portion sizes vary.The filet mignon once heated was medium well.  So did not enjoy especially at extra $12Overall very good though.  Very tasty.,4
1665,Factor_,"Great taste, not the best ingredients","Love the flavors and varieties of meals, but I wish there wasn‚Äôt so much cheap seed oils in the ingredients. It really messes with hormones and is terrible for you, and a big health difference between cooking at home versus eating out is that you can choose to use olive oil for example instead of sunflower seed oil etc. so this service is disappointing in that respect.",3
1666,Factor_,Overall good company!,"The meals were tasty, quick to make and packaged nicely. The communications between Factor and me were clear, timely, and easy to understand. It was easy to cancel weeks though slightly challenging for to change the number of meals delivered. You can only cancel one week at a time as far as I could figure out.",4
1667,Factor_,"Missing meals, frozen, vomiting",Disappointed that two of my meals were missing. I was never told that they would be. I just came back to Factor after having been with Cook Unity. I left Cook Unity because it was the same food week after week and they put MSG in some of their meals.My factor meals were also frozen which they say they never are. After eating the first meal  I vomited multiple times.,3
1668,Factor_,Easy to use website and app,Easy to use website and app. Got my first order done easily and get regular email reminders to update my menu for the next week if desired. Couldn‚Äôt be easier. Meals are good and selection is good.,5
1669,Factor_,"Perfectly portioned, healthy, and delcious","I've tried a lot of subscription meal services as I'm a single female, no children, with an extremely demanding job. I always preferred ones with little prep. I had been noticing a lot of inconsistencies with them and decided to give Factor a try. I've used it for about a month now and I've enjoyed every meal. Even the ones that I thought wouldn't be my favorites turned out to be great. The meats are tender which is not a usual thing when it comes to these subscription services. The meals are completed and ready to heat and eat, so I don't have to worry about wasting time I don't have each day. The variety each week in choosing meals is nice and I find myself trying to eliminate excess meals to stay within my box limit. A limit that I set for myself, of course, as factor allows you to add meals to your weekly boxes if you'd like.   They have been consistent and that is something I appreciate. This isn't just a good fit for a single, busy person. I have friends with large families that want something like this for lunch meals to take away some of the cooking stress.",5
1670,Factor_,Great packaging and delicious food,,5
1671,Factor_,Not for me,"Selecting weekly meals was convenient, and I appreciated the reminders from Factor regarding meal options and delivery notifications.Food quality was okay but not great.  The level of salt was reasonable, if not a bit light, which is a good thing.I decided to discontinue my subscription in an effort to reduce the amount of single-use plastic in my household (each meal comes in a plastic tray with plastic film covering), and I didn't feel like the meals were any more healthy than what I prepare at home.  My family of three never made it through the 6 meals in our weekly deliveries, and the price for 4 meals was higher than I want to pay.",3
1672,Factor_,Food was good,"Food was good. Shipping/delivery was an issue. 2nd box arrived a day late. 3rd box arrived a day late and missing a meal. 4th box never arrived and that's when I canceled.

Reached out and they were going to credit me back the $46.00 for the missing meals and ones I couldn‚Äôt eat becuase I was cancelling.  Instead they credited me $16 and did not cancel as they said they would.",3
1678,Factor_,Don't use factor,"Don't use factor. they use a delivery company called Veho. They will open your boxes and take meals from them. and when you complain about them they will magically lose your package. or bump up by 1 day your delivery date by making sure your delivery spoils. and then tell you it can't be delivered because of food safety. So at this point, I've had 21 meals not delivered in 1 month. also when they give you credit you can't use it until your promo runs out. and the promo is like 10 weeks. it's sad because I had a lot of coworkers at Wego ask me about Factor_. and after a month I told them to look elsewhere. the delivery company Veho is what holds Factor_ back. I've closed my account. and I'm not going to use them again. I'm sure this will not make it to their customer reviews. but I just had to write it.",1

1722,Factor_,On receiving my first box of factor‚Ä¶,"On receiving my first box of factor there was a recall of items I had already eaten. I had eaten them thinking I‚Äôd messed up the cooking instructions because I was still new to the subscription, but was completely upset to learn that the reality was much worse than that. The food was actually not supposed to be eaten at all. I loved the honesty and transparency on the part of factor but I was told I‚Äôd be refunded for those meals and I don‚Äôt believe that has happened. They gave me chocolate in my next box, which was really sweet at face value, but cutting out sugar was my New Year‚Äôs resolutions so coming face to face with chocolate I did not order was actually quite vexing. I wish they had just threw in a double of a meal I‚Äôd already selected for my next box. The meals, besides the earlier hiccups, were very nice and the website offers a really good variety. Factor makes it possible to be healthy on the go and after a few boxes, I‚Äôll be honest I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll stay. I‚Äôll say it‚Äôs at the very least, worth a try!",3

Typically when life gets busy for me like it has lately, I end up ordering out a lot and since I‚Äôve been trying to reign in my finances this has been a great solution. It‚Äôs more expensive than making everything myself to yield leftovers but it‚Äôs less expensive than ordering out so it‚Äôs a great balance between the two in my opinion. I would give 5 stars if there were gluten free meal options‚Ä¶not every meal has gluten but it would be nice if GF was one of the meal preference options since a couple people I know that I wanted to share it with have gluten intolerances.

It's sad because I've enjoyed everything I've tried so far.  The website lacking details on what was shipped is very disappointing.

1913,Factor_,A lot of the meals are frankly gross,"A lot of the meals are frankly gross, and for that price, I could have bought a much tastier (and better portioned) meal from a restaurant! I typically think the portions are too small (like 1 small chicken breast with 6 small pieces of broccoli and 3 grape tomatoes). The chili has been adequately portioned, but the sides are always soggy and yucky tasting, and don't fit with the meal-like that chili had taste but no crunch, it would have been great in a lettuce wrap. Plenty of times though, it is not tasty-it's steamed green been or green pepper flavor, even if there are neither ingredient-that type of stringy, wet, mushy/soft airplane food has hit the mark far more frequently than any of my Factor meals have. Unfortunately my favorite (and only meal I really liked-liked) was the small one-piece-chicken, 6-piece-broccili/3-grape-tomatoes, and while flavorful, the proportions were horrible! And that's the ONLY meal I've really liked. Others like the chili I've been OK with... I can't honestly think of another that I've been OK with, they've all been really bad for the most part! It makes me wonder where these reviews are coming from! EXORBANTLY priced, typically WAY too small portion, everything tastes the same-yuck-worse-than-airplane-standard, overall Factor has been horrible. Oh yea! And the undercooked chicken last week that no one emailed about but was definitely undercooked. Seeing that they have emailed in the past about undercooked meat (it wasn't from one of those meals they emailed about) apparently it's common. This test will be coming to an end soon, and I can only say that if you don't have meals on wheels and can't taste anything and have cash to blow, maybe it's a better alternative for you.",2

I have yet to receive any first due to limited availability and then because they only preselect my meals and not shots. Imagine which I‚Äôm more particular about.Then, I got a box with only ONE meal in it. One, not four. I was issued a credit so instead of getting my actual money back for replacement groceries, I must now risk disappointment yet another time. Also, I have tried multiple meal services.

1941,Factor_,"Food is unhealthy, site is confusing","I think a website is very confusing. I selected 20 meals what I thought was per month, turned out to be per week. Could not, for some reason, figure out how to make changes to the menu, so I ended up with 20 meals to eat until next Wednesday. And week after that. That's not even the worst part. All the meals contained a life threatening amount of fat. Each meal has 100% DV of saturated fat, and 50-70% of cholesterol!!! Didn't taste too bad, but I got a stomach ache and nausea  afterwards both times I ate their meals.

How do the plans differ in terms of macronutrients or total calories? Factor doesn't know. Does the plan usually come with fish each week? ""It depends."" Factor gives customers almost no information on what to expect each week, unless you log into your account and adjust the meals manually each week, which I don't want to do.Factor support has been, in my experience so far, terrible. I reached out via email, they replied but did not answer my questions, I replied to the email, and then I never heard back from them. I called the support phone number and had a similarly frustrating experience. Poor communication, not much help.",3
1945,Factor_,Advertise themselves as healthy,"Advertise themselves as healthy, but their food is loaded with saturated fat unless you go vegan.

I have only had one meal I was not as big of a fan of but it wasn‚Äôt bad, just not my taste. In terms of improvement, I wish they had a greater variety of vegetables. There seem to be many meals with green beans but not as many other veggie options, which can get a little monotonous. Also, the plastic can be hard to get off at times and I cut my finger on the side of the plastic twice.

I was never contacted and when I reached out to the company (after 8pm since it was supposed to be delivered by 8pm) I was told that the driver had returned it to the warehouse and they would credit my card on file for the meals. This was frustrating as I worked the next day and didn't have time to go food shopping - as I thought I had 10 meals arriving.The next week half of the chicken meals were recalled for being undercooked.I appreciate the transparency and the good customer service.

I called and said I would be out of the country so I would not be making a decision until I return. Without me sending in an order a box automatically started coming to my house. I was not here. I called customer service to stop the box. They assure me that the box would be stopped. The box would return three weeks in a row. They told me to donate the box to somebody. I was out of the country so I wasn‚Äôt able to do that. When I returned I had to call several times before they stopped sending the box. This is very frustrating and demeaning to me where you‚Äôre assuring me that the box will not show up at the house the box kept coming. I finally canceled whatever you had gone through my credit card by going to the bank and spending three hours trying to figure out what was going on PERIOD. Your advertisement says if a person doesn‚Äôt make an order by Tuesday that they won‚Äôt receive an order that we may have to wait a week to get another order. This process should not be automatic first you should not be picking food for me. Secondly, you should not be spending my credit card without my permission so the weekly check in for the weekly Order would give you permission to charge my charge card and tell you what I would want . I was out of the country for a month and this was very very demeaning. To me wasting food is to me is a sin and a shame . I was very disappointed in the whole process.

I ordered a special holiday meal, and the dessert was missing.  It‚Äôs really disappointing.  The last box I received was the first time that they notified me before I got my box that a meal was missing.  For all the others I had to call in.  It would be nice to be able to choose a backup but I‚Äôm sure that would be difficult for Factor.  I get reimbursed for the missing meals, I just wish they would all be there.

I ordered from Mountain Rose Herbs because I had a couple people who told me about this company. They spoke highly about their experiences. When the dandelion route arrived, I could see immediately that it was properly dried by the color. For those who don‚Äôt know high heat kills the medicinal properties of dandelion root.

2256,Mountain Rose Herbs,Where Have I Been?,"As a doctor of Oriental medicine whose 22 years of practice were, and still are, guided by the principles of Chinese dietary principles, Chinese herbal medicine, and the many other cultural principles surrounding the wisdom of that medicine, I am gobsmacked by my recent discovery of Mountain Rose's story and online presence.Many shoppers may be aware that all those principles mentioned above are guided by one attribute and characteristic above all‚Äîquality.  And that attribute was everywhere I looked on my first visit to the website, followed closely by 'caring'.  It left little doubt that a purchase would arrive within the same aura.  Of course, Mountain Rose is not a purveyor of the Chinese pharmacopeia, so that explains in degree.  But it's still difficult not to be in wonderment that I have not encountered these fine people in a lifetime of cooking and eating vibrant meals of truly great food!The first order included some specialized salts and a bottle of Za'atar, a traditional Middle Eastern herb mix in a shaker bottle‚Äîperfect for verifying my anticipation of what I would receive.Without even opening the box, it confirmed that the experience within was going to be good.  I immediately began implementing the use of these first products (perfectly packaged) in our morning habit of Breakfast Like an Emperor‚Äîand the experience of 'emperorship' was quite noticeably elevated!As I prepared for my next purchase, I forwarded a product link to an item being considered to my wife, also a doctor of Oriental medicine.  She's a very busy woman, and I had to laugh when, very shortly, she replied with some requests of her own.We are both delighted with our experience, and today, eagerly awaiting that shipment's arrival.Go, Mountain Rose!  And thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your palpable dedication to your business, its presentation, its unfailing quality, and the products which quite obviously receive your love of creativity, attention, and the ability to give form to that dedication.  I've never experienced culinary herbs of this quality!We anticipate continued head-shaking amazement and contentment.",5

2259,Mountain Rose Herbs,Just great customer service!,,5
2260,Mountain Rose Herbs,Be aware of their return policy,"Nice products but be aware their return policy is set up to strongly discourage buyer returns. You have to package the item, take it to the delivery service of your choice, pay for shipping, pay for tracking/proof of delivery then follow up on the refund and they know that will generally cost you more than the item so its guaranteed you'll just chunk it.

I really love their chamomile, it's so so fragrant. The whole roses are amazing.  I've ordered dried roses from other shops before, and although they smell pleasant, they don't look it.  But the roses from MRH *look* pretty, which actually now that I think of it isn't that big a deal for the sachets I made, but if you were going to fill a potpourri bowl, or scatter them as decorations, or use them in some other herbal preparation, it would matter.  Really very happy, planning to order again.",5

I have purchased multiple herbal teas for myself and loved ones (all of us have loved them) as well as bath salts, and I plan to purchase more bulk teas and natural body care products for myself in the near future. The customer service is very good; I had a question about an item arriving in time for Christmas, and got a sweet and thorough response within hours, from an on-site employee. This is SO rare these days, and I really appreciate it. Also, the quality of the products is amazing. It's really hard to find teas and body care products without preservatives, dyes, added sugars, natural flavors, etc, and this is one place where I can obtain some totally pure products. This is so essential. The only constructive criticism I can think of is that it would be awesome if they could hire more employees for their warehouse, because shipping orders does tend to take a little while. But it's honestly worth the wait for such quality herbs. Thanks so much, and keep up the great work. I'll be back x infinity!",5

2797,Mountain Rose Herbs,Just the best of businesses,"I live in Canada, and there was a holdup at the border with delivery of my order from Mountain Rose.  The company kept a very strong eye on the border agents, and sent me various forms; I think they must have intervened half a dozen times.  If it hadn't been for Mountain Rose, my special salts (which I'd ordered to herbalize for Christmas gifts) would have sat there until well after Christmas.  I love the quality of everything this company sells.  I love their philosophies of ""no waste"" and ""buy nothing day"".  I love the fact that they arrange for farms to grow herbs that are endangered.  My Salvia Apiana that was grown in this way was delivered in a huge bag, lots of thick stems to preserve the mere 4 oz of leaves in their wholeness, the aroma filling the house in a delightful way.  Now that is the way herbs should arrive!  As well, Mountain Rose has a regular blog that is informative and helpful.  This is a company that deserves to be the most frequented in the USA, if not all of North America.  In Canada, I find the exchange rate and customs difficult, but I'm sure that at least once a year I will still order from Mountain Rose.",5

However we received the email confirmation and the order was correct.The messaging and delivery updates were slow and inaccurate. Upon receiving an email saying our order has shipped we found that though the FedX number was established, the package was not in their system. This was true of all three orders. Strangely one order was delayed  and separated from the other two.We had to check every day to see if FedX had actually picked up the orders. No information was sent on that and when finally we received an email the order had been delivered. We had hoped to be able to advise our friends and family when to expect their delivery. This was not possible the way your cumbersome system works. Finally, as an example of the delays experienced, we received yesterday the notice that the final of the three orders had been delivered. Actually, it was delivered the day before yesterday with no notice to us. All this took an inordinate amount of time placing the order, tracking the deliveries and worrying that with the huge time window you give customers for the delivery our orders would not arrive before Christmas.If you improve your messaging it would be helpful to people.

I needed to get back to work so I didn't have time to argue with her and decided I would just call their customer support later.

The staff at the Swineshead Road store try this scam everytime we‚Äôve ordered certain drinks.Not getting what you‚Äôve paid for would be totally unacceptable anywhere else, it really is false and deceptive business practices. I never experience this scam elsewhere. Imagine buying a car and the car dealership gives you a different car to what you‚Äôve paid for. Or if you bought a meal in a restaurant and they give you a plate with half the meal missing.The staff at this Starbucks store get very angry and start shouting insults at customers whenever we mention it to them, it‚Äôs like the staff think it‚Äôs the Customers fault that the staff are not making the drinks how they should be made.

But when I ordered it from this place in Southampton and got a cup of hot milk handed to me I took it back where I was told by the barista he can‚Äôt make that drink then offered me something completely different! I did say maybe he should be working somewhere else and asked for my money back. After a bit of under the breath mumbling he put the refund back to my phone (Apple pay) so guys if you have a specific requirement then Starbucks (or at least that one) isn‚Äôt the shop for you. the logic uses was utterly bizarre and I sure won‚Äôt be going back there again. The kicker is my refund still hasn‚Äôt made it back to my account yet (4 hours later) update: 3 days later still no refund looks like the guy who can‚Äôt make coffee knows how to *make* money,1

4056,Starbucks,star bucks sux!,"I've been buying from star bucks for a while and always look forward to the birthday surprise every year.  I always get an email and an offer in app for a free item once I meet the requirement of buying 1 item.  This year I didn't get either,  so I was puzzled and contacted customer service chat. They gave me instructions of having to qualify by buying 1 item,  which I already knew,  but I usually don't need to buy an item to receive the offer.  After going back and forth about this in multiple ways,  the person said he'd send an email for the birthday reward offer within a couple days.  Well of course I didn't get it and contacted them again.  The person said the same thing as the 1st. Which doesn't make sense because after I get the offer, I have to buy an item to qualify anyways. They treat me like I'm trying to steal or something! So after having the same conversation with the second person and telling them i contacted them before my birthday and after telling them the 1st person was going to send the reward email, they ended the chat.  Usually customer service asks if there was anything else they could help with.  Nope just ended it like they were done talking with me!",1

4085,Starbucks,Rosemont Fashion Outlet Mall,"I have to say my last few encounters have been less than satisfactory but this last one was disgusting.  On October 22, I went to the Starbucks in Fashion Outlet Mall in Rosemont IL.  I ordered a Venti Pineapple passion fruit lemonade with light ice. I received the drink and noticed there was a lot of pineapple in it, Great after I walked away and took about 3 sips I noticed my drink was almost gone. When I took a closer look the cup had about 70 percent Ice. i stoppped drinking it and went back upstairs to the young lady who made the drink and said ‚Äúexcuse me I asked for light ice and I noticed that this cup is almost full of ice‚Äù. She looks at me and says, ‚Äúwell you already drank half of it, I don‚Äôt know what you want me to do‚Äù. Then laughed and turned around.  This young lady‚Äôs name is Jordan. If I ask for a venti and I take 3 sips  of a drink and it‚Äôs almost gone that means there was too much ice in the cup, which proves my point. As someone who has been in management and customer service for years, it pains me that this is what customer service has come to. And to make matters worse. The last 3 out of 4 times I have ordered from Starbucks my order was incorrect. I circulate quite a bit of money with Starbucks most of the time I use the app but from time to time I do not.  I am not sure that I want to continue going to Starbucks.  I do hope this matter is taken care of, because being disrespectful to customers after not giving the customer what they ask for is awful.

Obviously the reward scan had not gone through, yet again. I have a number of Mastercard receipts to prove that this has happened a number of times before. I queried the receipt which did not have decaff and was told that it hadn't gone through on the till. Coffee was given to me in espresso cups, with a D on the espresso cup receipt which was supposed to be decaff and the hot milk was cold milk. So, I didn't get what I had asked for and I didn't get the rewards. Very, very poor service. Once again if I could give less than 1 star, I would.

I am not a big lover of those sugary, syrupy, aromatic beverages whether they are cold or hot because of my diet, but i remember I used to love them with all my heart, and the thing that got me hooked on starbucks was a chocolate chip frappuchino, then came the cool lime during hot summer days.but as we all grow up, we don't want to see anything but the bitter, regular old black coffee with that great taste that just wakes you up and gives you energy. Love it.",5
4141,Starbucks,It's delicious,There are different opinions about these coffee shops. Some consider them to be a place where only those who want to fill their social networks with content gather. I think they just make good coffee. That's why they're so popular.,4
4142,Starbucks,Everyday in the morning...,It‚Äôs my morning routine to go to Starbucks before work. Or during work if I am on my remote job.Although I don‚Äôt think they have the best coffee.

4143,Starbucks,I went to the new Starbucks opposite‚Ä¶,"I went to the new Starbucks opposite East Croydon station - on arrival there were two people at the tills, both of which were looking down and occupied. My son and I stood there for a few minutes waiting to be acknowledged. One lady then said she had a problem with her till. (I think she was the manager as she was wearing something different to the others) The other lady (still ignored us, no eye contact the whole time) proceeded to do something to her till, then walked off. !! I couldn‚Äôt believe it. I‚Äôve worked in retail for 12 years and it‚Äôs a bit much but if we did not acknowledge a customer within 15 seconds, it was flagged. After another few minutes (now with a long queue behind) the lady that acknowledged me (who had gone off to do other things) calls someone from the back to take my order. If I was on my own I would have left, I was very close to walking out, but I promised my 8 year old son a frappacino and he was being very patient. He even wondered and asked me why they were not serving us.. anyways,  I order and it‚Äôs fine. Then the lady who made the fraps was amazing, great attention to detail. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll come back to this Starbucks based on the experience of being ignored, it was actually very upsetting. I would go to other Starbucks. This is the first time I‚Äôve had this experience at Starbucks. The staff are normally very friendly as soon as you walk in.",1

After several unqualified jiggles of the cables, he switched to the second checkout and the game started all over again. He asked me again completely for the order. When I went to the counter afterwards, the waitress just started sweeping out the room instead of making my coffee. She saw me, but left me standing unnoticed,Only when another waitress came in after about 10 minutes did she start making the coffee and wordlessly handed me the cup over the counter.The wait time and the behavior of the staff is in no way acceptable.

Palm Desert/La Quinta, CA *Washington and Hovely, *Ave 42 & Jefferson St. *Hwy 111 & Jefferson I was even told by another customer recently how great that was to have this special bond with the employees, that she wished she had this same personal experience. When you go to Starbucks everyday like I do and work in customer service yourself, you are usually more understanding, kind, courteous, generous and respectful because you know and understand what it‚Äôs like to work with the public. So many people lack basic manners and civility these days. Way too many are demanding, entitled and rude. I will never be one of those people so therefore my experience is excellent! Always looking for the positive, while having an attitude of gratitude what could go wrong? I always enjoy a minute of small talk with Danielle, Enrique, Ayden, Dylan and all the other baristas I didn‚Äôt mention while I wait for my drink. I always mobile order and I love that feature! The app is great. I love earning double stars on particular days, doing the challenges to earn extra stars, because who doesn‚Äôt love a ‚Äúfree drink.‚Äù I know it‚Äôs not really free because you spend a lot of money to accumulate stars in which you can cash out for the drink of your choice.

4210,Starbucks,Average Experience,"Starbucks, a popular coffee chain, offers a familiar coffee experience, but there are areas where improvement is needed. While it has its merits, there are aspects of Starbucks that could be enhanced to provide a better overall customer experience.One of the positives of Starbucks is its consistent coffee quality. The range of coffee options and customizable beverages cater to different tastes, allowing customers to find their preferred flavors. The availability of seasonal drinks and limited-time offerings also adds variety to the menu.However, one drawback is the pricing at Starbucks. The cost of their beverages can be considered higher compared to other coffee establishments, making it less budget-friendly for some customers. A more competitive pricing strategy would be appreciated, particularly for regular customers.Another aspect that could be improved is the speed of service. During peak hours, wait times can be quite long, resulting in delays and potential frustrations. Enhancing the efficiency of order preparation and streamlining the service process would help alleviate this issue.Moreover, the atmosphere of Starbucks can vary depending on the location. While some stores provide a cozy and inviting environment, others may feel crowded or lack seating options. Ensuring a consistent and comfortable atmosphere across all Starbucks locations would contribute to a more enjoyable coffee experience.Furthermore, although Starbucks has made efforts to introduce more environmentally friendly practices, such as the use of reusable cups and initiatives to reduce waste, there is still room for improvement in their overall sustainability efforts. Striving for more eco-friendly practices, such as increased recycling options and reduced packaging waste, would align with the growing consumer demand for environmental responsibility.In conclusion, Starbucks offers a familiar coffee experience with consistent quality and a diverse menu. However, areas such as pricing, speed of service, atmosphere, and sustainability practices could be improved to enhance the overall customer experience. Despite these shortcomings, Starbucks remains a popular choice for many coffee enthusiasts, and with continued efforts to address these concerns, it has the potential to provide an even more satisfying coffee experience.",3

This time we had a giftcard and placed our order wich came to 16.25. The gift card had 15 dollars on it and I had 1.12 in change so i was literally short 13 cents. The worker was very smug and told me she would take one of the drinks off and I proceeded to ask if using my debit card for that little of an amount would give me a service charge as she turned her back to laugh and talk to coworkers. Her behavior was unprofessional and her attitude very unpleasant. She also gave us no napkins or straws along with the lid to one of the drinks not secured or in place causing it to spill all down my arm as she handed it to me.

She told me she had a customer to take care of and I said to her that I was also a customer and she should make my drink when it was my turn. I wanted ristretto shots, but they pulled relatively weak, so I asked her to make it again. Instead of doing so, she starts filling up the vanilla container. Now there were six others there that could have been helping out, but instead, they were chatting in the corner. It was taking way too long, so I decided to walk out without my drink.

Making sure they have enough staff for the drive through and the coffee shop, they need to start caring more and not having staff that are just disposable and that they can keep replacing.

The staff were pleasant and friendly and the caf√© was spacious and bright. However, upon taking our seat there was a lot of dropped cake/flapjack all over the floor which didn't give a good impression. My Dad also had to remind the barrista about a cookie I had ordered and also ask for the warm milk i had ordered to accompany his Americano. Amongst our order was my hot chocolate which was far from hot and as a result I had drank it in about 2 minutes so as not to waste it. The queue at that time had grown and with a 4 year old in tow, I had thought by the time I queued again, he would be done and ready to go. After spending just over ¬£12 I did leave feeling a little hard done by. It was a shame really as the caf√© itself clearly has a lot of potential to do very well.

The most frustrating part is that there were no signs indicating the change in weekend opening hours from 5 am to 6 am, and when I attempted to order at the drive-through, nobody responded despite multiple employees being present inside. This level of service is unacceptable! To make matters worse, I am concerned for the safety of healthcare workers who rely on this coffee to stay alert during long shifts.

They said they would refund it but it would take 1 to 2 weeks to actually be done, almost as if giving me a middle finger and saying ""we'll do it when we feel like it"" even though I really needed that money today. If you ever have to interact with Lisa M. just ask for a different supervisor, she does NOT care about customers in the slightest.",1

Customer service, as a company, is plummeting. Prices have skyrocketed, outpacing inflation.Their star rewards program has been changed to the point where you have to buy approximately 9,723 drinks at full price to get an alternative milk for no upcharge on drink number 9,724. And then you have to start collecting stars again from zero.  Collect enough to get a free drink? Not anymore--it will take you a cool half mil to buy enough coffee from them to earn a free drink. And don't get me started on their Little Debbie-style pastries. They're overpriced flavorless junk.And Olive oil coffee? Wth? Excuse me--gotta be pretentious--""Oleato"". What happened to the sugar free or light flavors Starbucks used to have? Now their only option is sugar free vanilla. No light fraps. No light mocha. No light lattes. But you certainly CAN order a white chocolate, olive oil latte with vanilla sweet cream cold foam for a total of 3,000 calories ... Gross.",1

4312,Starbucks,"Worst Fast Food, 12yrs","Starbucks is the worst fast food restaurant. (I would like to preface that I don‚Äôt eat fast food and so I don‚Äôt really know any fast foods. ) They pull you in with flashy advertising and promise of good taste just to pay 2 dollars for a coffee you could‚Äôve made at home for less. Take their coffee, it is 2.10 cents for a plain, no nonsense drink. Compare that to a 1.69 cents large coffee from Mcdonalds, you get so much more bang for your buck and it doesn‚Äôt taste half bad. But we have to consider these arguments coming from a twelve year old who doesn‚Äôt. Yes, it is accessible and easy to find and when you are away from home it seems like the best option, but in reality you are just racking up the bills to eat something you have convinced yourself is tasty. Their food isn‚Äôt that bad. But you can really only say that when you haven‚Äôt eaten in a couple hours and you are running on a starbucks drink. Their customer base has sold their soul to the franchise so largely that they can convince themselves that frozen reheated eggs and wilted spinach tastes good. Now I don‚Äôt know everything and since most of the starbucks fanbase is a lost cause I can really only say this as an avid starbucks hater. Everyday I wake up surrounded by Starbucks lovers. I‚Äôve witnessed the addiction first hand and if I am going to be honest, it is not pretty",2

In my view, it's more of a status symbol than a genuine appreciation for their coffee. However, I personally enjoy their coffee, particularly when blended, despite not being a fan of hot coffee. Although it is quite expensive, with a single cup costing up to $6, they can charge such exorbitant prices because consumers like myself continue to purchase from them. Their baked goods, such as the banana nut bread, may not be very appetizing, but I find them aesthetically pleasing. Ultimately, taste preferences vary, so it is up to each person's discretion. On a positive note, the staff at Starbucks are generally quite pleasant, which is definitely a plus.",3

HOWEVER, today, Boxing Day, we went for our usual ""fix"" before my wife had to go to work at the hospital. There were just 2 members of staff working and the place was rammed. Queues, in store and at the drive through. Sadly, staff sickness meant they were a few people down. The 2 staff members were working their socks off. The problem was compounded by telephone orders being collected as well. Now, I was in management for many many years and if any of my teams were ever under pressure, I would help out myself. So, a plea to the franchise owners of this site: you must have known your employees were under pressure, so go into the store yourself and help them out. Don't think you are ""above"" such things as these hardworking people are your link with your customers...not you! Could be a great New Year Resolution for you??",5

Several minutes later rude scruffy member of staff told us that no dogs were allowed. Pointed out that the 3 members of staff behind the counter must have seen himAnd said nothing. Our dog is very well behaved and was not bothering anyone.  We did not want our coffees in take away cups and asked for a refund. By the time this has all been sorted we could have finished our coffee instead of being embarrassed by being asked to leave a coffee shop! Their customer service is also not very good as we complained direct to them and have not received a reply. We are frequent visitors to Starbucks (at other outlets with the dog) but not any more!",1

My discontent is now exactly because of that, but for the way the cashier looked at me when I kindly asked for whipped cream.

4391,Starbucks,Yet another Horrible Experience at Starbucks‚Ä¶,"Yet another person with a Horrible Experience at a Starbucks... Specifically, the Starbucks at Johnson Creek Crossing in Portland, Oregon. I was trying to give my order at the drive-thru, but apparently the person who was taking it couldn't hear me very well. A short, decaf vanilla mocha non-fat no-whip. Still, she had every thing right but the vanilla, so when she asked me if it was right, I said ""Everything but the vanilla."" She said she was having trouble hearing me, so I said loudly ""Va-nil-la!"" She said she was still having trouble hearting me, and for some unknown reason changed the drink to a grande vanilla latte, so I said loudly ""Moch-a!"" and then asked her why she changed the drink/size? She said she more about not being able to hear me, so in a very loud voice I said ""SHORT... DECAF... VANILLA... MOCHA.. NONFAT... NO WHIP"" At which point she said I was treating her badly and refused to take my order. After some pointless back and forth I asked for the manager. She claimed she was the manager. I asked for the contact information for her supervisor. She insisted that I come up to the window, and after waiting for other customers, I did, and she gave me the business card for her supervisor.  I asked for her name, which she refused to give me because I was being ""too aggressive"". She also claimed that the name on her apron was not really hers. I asked for a way to identify her with the supervisor and she would only give me three digits from her employee number. Suffice to say, after telling me multiple times she couldn't hear me and then, in a clearly passive aggressive manner, refusing to take my order when I tried saying it loudly enough so that she could hear me, I find it hard to imagine ever wanting to put myself through this again. It's a shame - after 30 years of patronage, I think I'm done with Starbucks over-priced drinks and childish staff. It's not the first time I've experienced immature Starbuck staff, but it will be the last.",1

4463,Starbucks,Is the sanitizing product an industry secret or did the customer service reps just not read my emails carefully?,"I sent this email to Starbucks two days ago:""I bought three coffee drinks yesterday at a Starbucks I don't usually go to. The barista had a plastic container labeled ""sanitizer"" under the milk steamer nozzle with a cloth sitting in it. After every drink she took the wet cloth and wiped the steamer nozzle with it. She would then proceed to steam the next pitcher of milk without wiping the solution off. When I asked what the sanitizer was she said she didn't know, it was just whatever sanitizer they used. She then said if I could taste the sanitizer in my drink she could make me another one. I was disturbed by this, but took the drinks home anyway. By the time I got home I had decided I didn't want the drink and threw it away.The idea of drinking even a small amount of an unknown sanitizing chemical in my coffee was not attractive. Is this standard procedure at your stores? Is the sanitizing chemical considered safe in food?""I got this response the same day:""Thank you for contacting Starbucks. Hope you‚Äôre having a great day.[Name redacted], I am truly sorry to hear about the experience you encountered with your drink. In addition, I understand your concern regarding the sanitizing chemical. I can imagine how you must have felt, so I‚Äôm more than happy to turn this into a better experience for you.I want you to know that we take your concerns seriously.

Thanks for giving us the opportunity to fix something that went wrong.If you ever have any questions or concerns in the future, please don't hesitate to contact us.Have a lovely day!""I responded:""Thank you for your prompt reply.You have not really answered my questions. Is the sanitizer used in your stores typically left on the milk steamer? Is it considered safe for consumption? I would also very much like to know what the sanitizing product is that you use.I don't have a Starbucks card. You can send one to me at [address redacted].

I want to let you know that at Starbucks, we take providing a safe, clean, and welcoming environment to our customers very seriously. During these times, this is most certainly a top priority for us, this is why we always sanitize the store. However, is not normal that your drink could have any sanitizer taste, and like any other chemical product is not considered safe for human consumption. Let me escalate this situation with the District Manager of this store, in order to let them know what is going on there. Regarding with your card, by procedure we are not able to cancel a Starbucks Card order; however, you will receive this one, and once you receive the card you can spent the $20 that this card has.Thanks again for writing us. If you ever have any questions or concerns in the future, please don't hesitate to get in touch!Have a wonderful day!""Of course, I never said the coffee tasted of sanitizer.

The specialist said they couldn‚Äôt pay my medical bills (which is completely fine!), but the specialist kept talking about how I should have gotten the drink/cup tested while as I at the ER. The drink that I told him I already consumed, so nothing to test and my throat was closing up, so bringing an empty cup to get tested was not my number one priority. He then questioned when I bought the drink and insisted that the date and time that I ordered a drink was wrong even though it was a mobile order that was time stamped. He also accused me of going back to Starbucks that night, which I couldn‚Äôt have because I was in the ER. He also went on a tangent about how I should use my Starbucks reward points. The specialist consistently talked over and raise his voice with me and told me that there was no way Starbucks could help me (when all I wanted was an apology and no money), since the drink was never sent to a lab and tested. What a waste of time.",1

It is a poor excuse for a Starbucks as it moved from a large and inviting location to an ill thought out spot that is just a huge mistake; limited parking (mostly taken by the staff), an incredibly inefficient drive-up option with a incredibly undersized driveway, and a management crew that can‚Äôt run the business efficiently or effectively. The location routinely closes at 12 noon. Seriously. They can‚Äôt run an operation for more than 5 hours a day? Given your overhead this has to be a huge drain on someone‚Äôs bottom line.Duncan Donuts 200 yards away and a soon to open Coffee Shop and Bakery 200 yards in the opposite direction together are going to put an end to our local Starbucks.

I recieved a follow up email the week of september 4th beautifully written and rectifying the situation by sending me a gift card , so up until yesterday theyve called and emailed periodically almost all month now but i havent recieved a gift card as of yet, i contacted them to thank the gentlemen who made the effort to rectify the situation and also confirm that my mailing information as requested was correct to ensure that maybe the mail had went to the wrong address or improper email address if it was an ecard, i then recieved an email with an auto response with links to answer customer service questions , so after all the follow up was just as bad as the service that i recieved from the beginning, I've just decided although I enjoy the beverage,  and many other products and spend well when i visit, Sadly I will no longer patronize this or any other location.Another sad thing after i posted a review this morning theyve contacted me again saying they are having technical problems with shipping and once resolved they will attempt to rectify the poor service,however a gift card wouldnt be shipped it requires an envelope and stamp,also if there are technical issues,ecards exist also. Im sorry that this is the type the type of service going on at starbucks ,its even more troubling how the customer service department responds with responses to rectify and in the same email more excuses and more poor service.I dont want starbucks to send me anything at this point, the service is terrible and thats that,as I said I wont visit this or any other location any more.

Not let me check into that or I am sorry for the misunderstanding but am I sure HER website is wrong. Not the first time and I am guessing not the last.,3

4643,Starbucks,I was purchasing a coffee or two with a‚Ä¶,"I was purchasing a coffee or two with a friend when suddenly a man pushed in front of me he said sorry love and then proceeded to order his coffee. He had been waiting at the collection point. What a silly man. After he had ordered his coffee he went to fetch his girlfriend. She was a chav. Then she had the app for the points but the man didn‚Äôt know how to do the points on the app. Then the manager or maybe not the manager came. He looked sad because his house had burned down. Poor Joshua. Then Joshua said no points for you chav lady or maybe he said vhavette I don‚Äôt remember. Then she told him the lady with glasses and pink hair did it for her every time. I believe her because she had ¬£18 worth of points on her card!! She must be a good customer. She really told Joshua what was what and I think I saw a tear fall from his eye. The smiley face on his name badge was very deceptive. Then the chav lady got her points, she reminded me of ash a bit. Off she popped on her merry way with her coffee and a small shot glass full of cream. Then it was my turn to order. It was a hot day so I went for an iced coffee to help cool off and still get my caffeine fix. Joshua turned to me and said can I take your name I said yes it‚Äôs jade he said one minute jade and wagged his finger in my face to indicate that he would be one minute. When he returned after one minute he had stopped wagging his finger but he said what is your name and I said you‚Äôve already taken my name and he said what‚Äôs your name and then I laughed for a while and then he said Dan I take your name please and I got a piece of grass and whistled through it alerting my trusty dog to my side. The dog is owned by my neighbours cat. Anyway that‚Äôs a story for another time. Then Joshua made my drinks and had a cry. Then as abhi was making my drink Joshua went back to his phone call and started carrying heavy bags of stolen Starbucks goods to his car. I noticed lots of straws hanging out of his fly. In his clown sized shoes coffee beans spilled at each step. Kirkstall Leeds Starbucks full of thieves. I gave him ¬£5 for his house fund as it had burnt down and he was building it back with straws and coffee beans but he didn‚Äôt need to steal them. Mr. Starbucks is a fine employee good friend of Tim Martin. They are making a starspoons but that is strictly under wraps I hope the people at trust piolet can be trusted with this information. I enjoyed my coffee very much especially with the matinee performance. I think that Joshua will be Starbucks next top model and I fandy him please can you give him my email address. From jade.

4644,Starbucks,Starbucks Tonbridge high street - AVOID!!!,"Visited Starbucks in Tonbridge High Street. 3 members of staff working, no one in front of me waiting to order. We stood there for at least 5mins patiently, all the while being completely ignored by all 3 of the staff. It was only when I stepped right up in front of the till that one lady looked at me (almost in disgust) and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be with you in a minute‚Äù Why I had to wait 5mins for that I don‚Äôt know. That should have been as soon as I appeared. To continue the bad service, I then stood and witnessed order after order coming through on Uber eats or Deliveroo (whoever you use) which all got sorted straight away, queued up in front of my order which still hadn‚Äôt even been taken by that point. It was at this point that I walked out and went to Costa just along the high street. I appreciate the way people shop has changed and online is much more popular....but maybe you should think about closing your high street shops and opening up delivery hubs as it seems as though actual customers coming in in person to order a coffee (shock horror, how dare I?!) are far too much of an inconvenience.

4650,Starbucks,BEWARE When You Drink From Their Coffee Cups,"I have been a loyal SB Gold Card member for more than 10 years. Each day I buy 2 beverages, and on occasion, food or snack items.On a recent trip to a location in Florida, I ordered a hot coffee and other items. When I picked up the coffee from my car cup holder, the sides of the cup pushed in causing the lid to pop off and the coffee to spill on the center console of my car. Right on top of the technology ball that controls my radio, XM, NAV, cell, and internal features of the car.This is not the first time this has occurred. This is caused by the employee grabbing the cup and creasing the top pushing their fingers together and creating a crimp in the ridge. The crimp causes the lid to not properly seat on the top ridge of the cup causing it to pop off when you grab the cup toward the top of the outside about 4-6 inches from the top.SB has determined because the coffee was in my car at the time it spilled, they are taking no responsibility. I have decided based on the negative response I received from Starbucks Customer Service, I will no longer step foot in a store again, buy any of their products, or retain their stock going forward.",1

4697,Starbucks,Starbucks Frappuccino Uber Eats,"I ordered a Starbucks Frappuccino to be delivered through uber eats (which is a blended ice cold beverage) and the time it was going to take them to get me my order was 30-40 mins. Which is an incredibly long time for a cup of coffee to start with...however, I went ahead and ordered. My order time was delayed 3 different times because they were having a hard time finding a driver and was almost an hour late from the original time that was quoted, on top of the 40 mins I already had to wait for it to be prepared. When it arrives, it is completely melted and liquified. I was not notified that my order would be late or that they were having a hard time finding a driver, I had to go back to their page and look this up myself. Had I know this, I would have just gone and picked it up myself. I live down the street from Starbucks but was working so I opted to pay to have it delivered....however I could have driven there and back 11 times faster than it took for my order to be delivered today and I would have gotten it still iced and paid less money. I write this as a review for Starbucks because I have yet to be able to find another food delivery service that will pick up Starbucks orders except Uber eats. I am not sure if there is contract In place there but if so, I feel as though that should be reviewed because the service from uber eats and how they do business was unacceptable in my eyes. I don‚Äôt think it was on the fault of the restaurant because the drink is melted so clearly they made it when they got the order and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs on the fault of the driver because once a driver was assigned, he was very fast. This seems to be an issue with Uber eats themselves and how their system is set up to coordinate And schedule these transactions. On this particular reviewing website, 22,000 people had given reviews on Uber Eats and 95% of them were in the ‚Äúbad‚Äù category (the worst rating you can get).

The Americano was hot enough ,but was very weak. Only after doing a google search did I learn that cafe Americano is  watered down coffee. Who would want watered down coffee anyway? I have written to Starbucks to ask why Freshly brewed Decaff is not available. I was told it is ,but only in the early morning hours and untill 10 am. This is not the case. Starbucks offered me a gift card which was nice,but I told them I want an answer as to why Freshly brewed decaff is not available all day like their other coffee products. Starbucks has a multi-billion dollar operating budget but cannot offer freshly brewed decaff albeit to the few that request it! As of now , I still have not  been able to find  a Starbucks that offers a fresh brewed cup of Decaff. I have been to at least 6 different locations in the surrounding NY areas.

4712,Starbucks,Wanted to over charge us because they ran out of iced Venti cups!,My husband and I and our two teenage daughters waited in a really long line of cars in the drive-through to order a couple of iced Venti lattes. We could not go in because they put a sign saying they were closed due to Covid. When we finally got up to the window to order they told us they were out of iced Venti cups so we asked if we could just have the warm latte cup instead and they said no. They told us our option was to order all tall or grande coffees instead. Our plan was to get a couple of Vente iced lattes to share so we asked if we could just get a couple of extra cups and we could split it or if they could give us all tall iced lattes and just charge us for the price of a Venti. Their answer was absolutely no on everything. So essentially we would have to spend quite a bit more money to get what we wanted because they ran out of cups! They were completely inflexible and it was a terrible experience all the way around and a complete waste of time. Why should we have to pay extra money because they ran out of cups?!

I then immediately made a complaint with corporate who put me in contact with the district manager Jeff Neer. After speaking with Jeff he advised me that the cashier did not follow the proper store protocol and the receipts should have been placed in the cashiers draw. Although admitting the cashiers fault Jeff Neer refused to issue me a refund. I was referred back to corporate where I was only partially refunded.

Where was the social distancing? The drive-thru line made a circle around the entire parking lot. Being busy is a great problem to have but this particular store needs an immediate intervention. For someone to wait 45 minutes to an hour for coffee is absolutely ridiculous. When you pay for your coffee the cashier tells you it will be a wait but cannot give you an estimated wait time...absurd! Not only did I leave without coffee, I was late for work and on top of that the young lady gave me two $4 off cards for my next purchase but guess what I will never visit a Starbucks again because of this experience!I know that making this store bigger will not solve the problem immediately.

4820,Starbucks,Never in my life have I had an issue at‚Ä¶,"Go to WHITE ROCK COFFEE!!! not Starbucks off Gaston & Garland my 1st complaint ever. The barista who was wearing a lavender sweater was so rude that she she shrugged her right and left arms up with her hands up and said what's up loudly. That at this point I told her to get a manger involved to cancel out  my order. All this happened because she said I had to pay over $19 bucks when I had multiple stars to use my app as a reward at any Starbucks location. She kept on saying you need to pay and I told her to scan my cell to get the points redeemed and she said no you need to pay with your F****** ugly hair. This was so disappointing because my sister in law was the driver and she had did a order she didn't even place the drinks in a cup carrier she had to ask she drives up forward for me to pay next since I was sitting behind her on the driver side to pay for my items. That she got frustrated and made fun of my skin tone color that I straight up told her I'm not going to argue with you. Get someone else or a manger I don't feel safe since you said what's up to me as if your going to jump out the window. The assistant comes to handle it at this point I'm crying because I'm so out rate with the service I never had a issue till today Casey tells me no let me fix it. once she did the fees dropped down from $19 something to $5 something I told her she is lucky that I didn't even react back by calling her out her name just because I'm dark skin look all hood and ghetto like some b**** of the street doesn't give her the right to tell me to f****** pay or make fun of skin or hair color. They refused to give me the store contact info to complain  that I went online that during that interaction and Casey tells her to leave the drive thru window because she kept on instigating to provoke a reaction out of me waiving her hand in the air behind Casey that she kept telling her she needed to leave the area because she couldn't hear me and her. I told her it's not making the situation better. I started to cry even my sister-in-law told Casey she was rude and we asked her if she was okay. That I asked them to cancel my order to leave just my daughters drink. Than when I called to speak to the assistant assuming it is Casey she said her employee was gay. She told me so your calling my employee racist homophobic. I told her no never did I say that. I'm personally apart of the GBLT community myself. I would just consider that as SEREGATION to define your wording. She should of never disclosed her sexuality of the barista to me. Than she kept on saying she has had purple hair she was giving  you a compliment.  I always go there because I live by the White Rock area my number one store is Gaston and Haskell. they know how to handle high traffic drive and for the company I've worked for we purchase the jug coffee for business meetings or to give to customer to drive in traffic. Since that location has been shutdown due to road being reconstructed and  maintained and no water being provided the had to temporary shut down. Now they are stating they did  a incident report after I called them to get the managers store email they couldn't disclose i had to do the complaint on Starbucks website.  I told them if I was banned she said no that I needed to do a police report. I was like what a complaint and I have to call the police. I said the company can do a internal investigation. When I spoke to Casey by calling and told her I did the group chat they would follow up in three business days for the district manger she said I could no longer go back since she has a incident report on me. I was told I have to do a police report on Casey when was not Casey who was aggressive with me. I don't call anyone out their name in the food industry that I trashed the blackberry frap, the double chocolate chip frap with peppermint away the Iced chai pumpkin cream latte away and my sister in law trashed her order too the caramel macchiato with pumpkin spice, the pike roast AND THE CARAMEL FRAP TOO.  we where disgusted with the behavior. When using your Starbucks app why would we be problematic when the company has surveillance cameras and our profiles on the database of internal information for Starbucks. They are telling me I cant do anything and my complaint will not go anywhere until I file a police report. I went online and thank fully I recorded the conversation after I was told I was being recorded over the phone through Starbucks phone and I'm okay with the recordings because they will be able to do a internal investigation and decide who was in the wrong. Nestor did issue a -$10 credit but couldn't honor it for my sister in law due to credit limitations I never requested or expected it either. She will have to do complaint herself too. The entire time we had a baby in car he is still a infant and a teen-ager in the back seat. We would never place our children's in a bad scenario. If we are banned that credit is useless",1

I kindly asked the barista if she could please make my coffee again with less ice. I received the second coffee without any foam and no ice; it was pure liquid! I kindly asked the barista if she could add a little ice and she added two cubes and reluctantly. When I tasted the coffee it tasted like pure milk. It seemed like the ice was removed from the first cup and filled with milk. I feel like I got ripped off. Never going back to this place.",1

4850,Starbucks,Syrup left unstirred at the bottom of the cup,"Overall I dont trust Starbucks employees to give me what is asked. I ask for extra hot which always comes just over warm which I am still fine with I guess. The only major issue in my opinion is the syrup at the bottom of the cup in hot drinks. Especially now due to Covid 19, we do drive through in Elder Gate Milton Keynes starbucks and don't get stirres to stir our drink nor we can do it in the car anyways. It would just make mess. My partner ordered machiato and white chocolate mocha. They both were Grande but machiato came 1 quarter less in the cup whereas mocha came with disgustingly sweet syrup at the bottom which made me throw quarter of the drink anyway. In short, may be try adding the syrup once the drink is done or simply stir it for us as there is no way for us to do it. Also leave little space at top but not quarter less so we get the amount we pay for at least. Just a suggestion.",2

4856,Starbucks,"INCOMPETENT, RUDE, AND DON'T TAKE RESPONSIBILITY, FOR THEIR ACTIONS, WHEN CUSTOMERS WANT THEM TO FIX IT!!!!","Okay.  So, first, I will say that I did already talk to the customer service people for this Starbucks location, and they have taken care of it, the only way they could.  Also, I'm talking about only one Starbucks location, that I keep having to go back to, because they have averaged about 2, sometimes even 3 times a month, if not more.  The 1 location that this has happened to over and over again, is the Starbucks in Manassas, Virginia, on Sudley Manor drive.  For the most part, at all of the other locations in Manassas, Virginia, they're usually pretty good at getting my order right, and they're usually very friendly.  But, not at Starbucks in Manassas, Virginia, on Sudley Manor Drive.  Not that one.  I have never ever had any restaurant at all mess my order up as much as they do.  And, when you call, and want them to replace it, because of their incompetence, oh, well, it's your fault.  What?, you mean, as much as we mess your order up, and you want it replaced?  How dare you, expecting us to replace your order, every time we mess it up, as much as we do.  Well, on Friday, August 28th, 2020, at about 8, or 830ish in the morning, that is how I was treated, when I expected this location to remake my order.  I was treated like complete crap, by the head manager, Rihanna.  Her crew, is a lot more friendly.  So, whatever you do, save yourself the money, time, and headache, and don't go to the Starbucks, on Sudley Manor Drive, in Manassas, Virginia.  Go to any of the other locations.  But, don't go to that one.  They seriously need to do some new training with their management team, or at least, that person at that one.  The people at all of the other ones are nice, pleasant, and positive people.  I don't care, if a place messes my order up every day, then I'm going to expect them to replace it, and to not be so rude about it.  Especially, if I'm going to pay $14.20 every time, because I order the same thing every time I go to any Starbucks.  So, to all of the other Starbucks in Manassas, Virginia, thank you for 90 percent of the time, not messing my order up, and when you do, which is very rarely, you resolve the problem, and you're very friendly.  Thank You so much.",1

Did they even field test these lids? I think not! The new lids need a baffel under the opening easy to do in a mold! I took a new lid & put a piece of scotch tape across below opening & no more splash! Wake up Starbucks & test your new splash lids! When my loaded app is out I am not going to be a customer any more!

4879,Starbucks,Yikes,"UPDATE:After two weeks, the burn mark on my thumb is finally going away. It is still peeling and bright pink, but I think the burn cream and ice I put on it after the incident happened, helped. Didn't know I needed a first aid kit to drink some coffee. LOLORIGINAL POST:On 7.12.20 I visited the Starbucks location at 899 Tahoe Blvd, Incline Village NV. My 2 friends went inside and I waited in the car because I was not in a, ""put your mask on"" kind of mood. FORTY MINUTES LATERThey emerge with 6 drinks. Why? Because after they were told I couldn't order what I wanted because it, ""doesn't exist"", they proceeded to screw up a 3 drink order, 3 times. (Interestingly, while my friends waited, 2 other customers returned with incorrect orders of theirs, too.)  I had originally ordered a decaf chai tea latte, which I order almost every day of the week without incident. (Having not had caffeine for years, I know when some sneaks in, so I don't think they've been giving it to me unnoticed.) My friend ordered me an herbal tea instead, which is apparently served in a temperature that could rival the surface of the sun. The lid wasn't put on properly, and it came off, spilling HOT tea all over my hand. The tea was literally up to the brim, and had I tried to drink it, I would have had burns all over my throat, neck, and chest. As it was, it burned my hand. I was trying to put the cup down because it was very painful being repeatedly burned, and now it was sloshing all over the place; mainly my feet, as I put it on the floor of the car. The damn thing was so hot, I had to use a beach towel to pick it back up to throw it away. I had zero interest in the drink now.Having been at this location long enough, and seeing how absolutely furious I was, I decided to not go inside and cause a scene. And a mighty scene it would have been! I chose to call and speak to the manager. Which I did, and he sounded bored and disinterested. ""Oh yeah the water comes out at 200 degrees, it's hot. You could come back in and we can remake it for you."" He sounded about 12 years old, and I did let him know that my purpose of the call was not to score additional drinks, but to make sure they stop being careless. Or to maybe suggest to corporate that not everyone wants their drinks hot enough to melt metal in. Why do you charge us upwards of $10 for a coffee, and then treat us like we're visiting a 7-11?Because I have to say, Starbucks coffee isn't the end-all of coffees. Customers expect better quality all the way around-we're paying for the coffee AND the experience. Get it?So, now, I have an ugly reddish purple spot on my thumb that is dry and cracked like leather. Sure hope it scars!To add insult to injury, I went to the Starbucks website to launch a complaint, and after I spent all of my time filling everything out, it wouldn't accept my complaint because I didn't put in my loyalty number or some such garbage. And then the website shut down when I was trying to locate the number from my app. Real nice, Starbucks. You rose to fame because you offered superior customer service, clean facilities, prompt and correct orders, etc. Now you're just like everyone else. Lazy, no attention to detail, flippant, and practicing the same tricks other companies do, so that you don't have to actually address the very people who buy your products that line your pockets. Perhaps you should focus on basic functions, rather than venturing off into staying popular with social fads. Had you put more effort and attention into properly training your employees and providing an excellent service, rather than focusing on baristas being able to (unprofessionally) advertise their personal political beliefs on their clothing, you'd be in a better situation. I come to a coffee shop to get coffee. I don't want to hear about how, ""crunk"" someone got over the weekend, or how they fashioned a Covid mask for their genitals. I also don't like watching 4 baristas chit chat whilst holding my made drink, thus tying up the drive thru line. (These are some examples from 2 Reno NV locations.)I don't know what has happened to Starbucks, but they're definitely not a place I am going to frequent any longer. And the worst part is they don't even care.",1

BS. So I tried to call them to cancel the order. 28 unanswered calls later someone finally answered and told me I had to go back to the store to cancel the order. Jesus. Anyway not a huge ordeal its a $10 or less order and I can go back when I have nothing to do but why should I have to wait in line to cancel an order when I was never in line in the first place? and why can't someone answer the phone so I don't spend more time calling?Update. After calling around to corporate (for a total of 32 calls for the whole ordeal) I finally got a refund processed to my card. My disbelief is in having to go through so many hoops just to get a refund for a $10.12 order. Lesson learned there is no benefit to using the online order system because its not a single second faster, and takes a lot longer to get a refund if something goes wrong.",1

Usually 2 inches short of the top.  Ask for whipped cream but even that is missing. Now that we are only able to use the drive thru with long lines it‚Äôs a waste of time coming back thru with a complaint if you don‚Äôt catch them when they hand you the drink.  Prices went up 10% in the last year and now they are not filling cups to the advertised level. This happen across all the Starbucks I frequent in central Virginia. Is this an overall trend in their business model?,2

OMG I think I got a psychological trauma then and now I'm getting so anxious when I see Starbucks, like every time I hear about it... I GET CRAZY. The woman and the whole staff there got me know about this place. I think I WOULD NEVER VISIT STARBUCKS AGAIN. Yeah, also I didn't get satisfied with the production. It's like basic and overrated. I got an extremely dry carrot cake, it was NOT TASTY AT ALL! There's nothing special in it! I'd say I cook better frappuccino in my house! So, now I'd like to say somethings to Starbucks: ""You don't know how big my wish is... I want to ruin your offices, I'd like to come into every Starbucks shop and ruin stuff there, ruin toilets, make your company feel sick.

4917,Starbucks,Starbucks will not serve you now.,"On the afternoon of May 4, 2020, at approximately 3:30pm, I made the choice to go to the drive-thru at Starbucks 2810 E. 116th St. Ste. 100, Carmel, IN 46033. Using information provided on the Internet, I saw that this store closed at 9pm, and was therefore still open. When I arrived at the drive-thru, there was a longer line than I would usually wait in at a drive-thru. Yet, I had my dog with me and we were enjoying the afternoon, and Starbucks sounded delicious. I joined at the back of the line of cars. The cars gradually moved forward, time passed, and finally, at 4:00pm precisely ‚Äì 30 minutes after I started waiting ‚Äì I reached the speaker. When I started to place my order, the customer service representative informed me that the car before me had been their last customer for the day, and I therefore would not be served. It would be an understatement to say I was surprised by this. In fact, I impulsively asked, ‚ÄúAre you serious?‚Äù And she was. She refused to serve me. I stated how long I had been in line, and that there had been no indication they were closing at 4pm, but she insisted, saying, ‚ÄúWell we close at 4pm!‚ÄùI had chosen to make Starbucks a part of my day. I was prepared to spend at least $15 on coffee and food that day. I spent half an hour of my day waiting in line to do just that. Yet when I had the opportunity to spend my money, I was denied service. This is outrageous. I have emailed, called, and chatted with Starbucks customer service. I have left reviews of this experience at Yelp, Consumer Affairs, and Google, in addition to smaller websites for customer feedback. Upon realizing that Starbucks neither needs nor values my patronage, I have discarded my Starbucks reward card, which I used often, and will not spend another cent at Starbucks. I will continue to take all measures possible to convince others that Starbucks does not value their customers and to ensure that this does not happen to anyone else. It‚Äôs such an insult that an inconsiderate barista felt it was acceptable to waste that much of my day, without even an apology. This outrage will not be soon forgotten.",1

My recommendation would be to add a bit more sauce quantity and thickness for taste",4
4987,Fresh N Lean,"Food is good, packaging is good. Delivery is not that good and the quantity is not that good too",The food is good and packaging is good too. Portion sizes and calories are sometimes not sufficient. They can add some carbs like rice which is cheap and high protein dishes. Biggest concern is delivery. I don‚Äôt receive messages on my phone and only emails. A few shipments were expired due to that.,3
4988,Fresh N Lean,Flavorful and quick to prep,"Mostly very flavorful, good tasting meals. My family enjoys them, and it saves us SO much time.

4991,Fresh N Lean,WOW!!!,"I alreOf all the meal plans I looked into, this one is the only one I liked. They have many choices for preferred diets, allergens to avoid, etc. They also try to use healthier ingredients (some keto, free-range chickens, and so on). The food arrives on time, perfectly packed. The customer service is absolutely superb. Best of all, my picky husband actually loves the meals. What else could you possibly ask for?Do be aware that all meal deliveries use the same iffy setup where before you can see the meal choices you have to go through the entire registering process. And while you may think that if you haven't chosen any meals yet, you are not committed. Think again. If you do not make your choices, you will still receive a shipment, of the ""chef's selections"". And if you think you have cancelled, it does not include the first shipment. I learned this the hard way with another outfit. The same happened here, but they handled it to my complete satisfaction.I am truly impressed with this company.ady wrote a glowing report",5
4992,Fresh N Lean,My order was delayed by UPS and Fresh N‚Ä¶,"My order was delayed by UPS and Fresh N Lean did not appear to be monitoring that. I began to wonder if I should eat the food when delivered late but there was never any cautionary communication from Fresh N Lean about not eating it when it arrives. When I contacted customer service, the options took more time than I would have liked (email contact form still has not been replied to, online chat session took a long time - I was 12th in line and once I made contact, the conversation took some time). I was offered a store credit on ""next billing cycle"" but I am not sure how billing cycles work - is that monthly?  weekly? I said I'd prefer a refund and was only then told that this would be an option, but at the amount paid, which was net of discount. Communication could be more thorough and clear (options explained). Could be faster and more prompt. Your team could monitor shipments and contact customers when not delivered by guaranteed date (Saturday). You could communicate with customers to let them know not to consume the food that will be delivered late. This is my first order and first experience with your company and I am, at best, confused. It remains to be seen if I will be disappointed when I receive my first shipment, which is now taking over 2 weeks from the date I first ordered.",3

4994,Fresh N Lean,The food tastes awful,"The food tastes awful! There is just no other way of saying it, the meat is overcooked and the vegetables are mushy, plus there is a strange spice used on almost every dish that does not agree with me, I have developed a rash on my stomach since getting the food and I believe it is an allergic reaction.  I have tried 5 meals in the first box and each meal is worse than the last. I cancelled my membership, but not before they had started shipment on a second box. While the lady that I reached on the phone was very nice, it was too late to stop the second shipment. Fortunately they did give me a refund for the second shipment.  ( I still have 10 meals I cannot eat)  I recommend if you are going to try this service, you get one box and taste it first before ordering any additional shipments.",1

The next thing I knew my card was charged $105 for food that I did not want and did not order.  I chatted with a representative to cancel it and was told it was too late.  I told them I didn't order and didn't want it.  Too late for that.  The food arrived a few days later and I was shocked by the nutrition fats on most of the meals.  Lean my but...some of the entrees have over 200% of the RDA of cholesterol and are very high in sodium.  I don't know where they get lean.  Lots of fat.  I decided to have one of the meals for lunch since I paid for the garbage.  Fresh...looks like canned dogfood.  I heat it up anyway and sit down to eat.  Tastes like canned dogfood too.  Do yourself a favor and stay away from this company.,1

After I reached out to tell them, they could offer no guarantees that it wouldn‚Äôt happen again and would do nothing more to acknowledge their mistake beyond giving me a credit for the 7 meals that I did not order/want.   I attempted to reasonably explain my frustration but no further solution was offered. I understand that mistakes happen but I don‚Äôt feel they took the issue seriously nor wanted to make it right it any way that would matter.",1

5006,Fresh N Lean,This company is ridiculous,"This company is ridiculous. I ordered my first week of meals to be delivered ""guaranteed"" by 1/6/24. They never arrived. This was hugely inconvenient, because now I must do last minute grocery shopping/food prep today. I contacted the company through their online chat. I was told they were unable to contact their shipping partner at that moment, but they would ""look into it."" I responded by saying I wanted a refund for the undelivered meals, which they did agree to. Then, I told them to please cancel my account, including all future shipments. I was told I could not cancel next week's shipment (1/13/24) because I had to do so by last Friday. But Friday was the 5th, and the delivery was guaranteed by the 6th, so obviously I didn't even know there would be a problem as of that date. I pointed out that there was no tracking info for the meals, so clearly they had not been shipped yet. The agent's response for why the order could not be canceled was that labels had already been printed. (Seriously?!?) Instead, I was told to ""wait and see"" if there was an issue next week and contact them again if there was. So this company that I wanted to use for convenience sake thinks I should have to wait until Saturday night each week to see if I get food delivered or not and then maybe plan to do shopping and food prep each Sunday. Absolutely ridiculous.",1

5014,Fresh N Lean,Poor customer service,"Poor customer service. They are selective in their response when you email them. On my first order, I had accidentally ordered twice and emailed them about it and received an email response from them the next day. However, on one of the subsequent orders, I emailed them about a broken package complete with pictures - no response. One time I needed to pause a delivery and went on their website to do so, but they delivered the box and charged me anyway. I called them about it and was told I should have checked for an email confirmation about the pause which I didn't: but how many people check for an email confirmation after they've made selections? They said they were going to have IT look into it and get back with me but they never did. About the food: it's a hit and miss. Some were good (the beef/steak products) and others were disgusting. For about $12/small microwavable meal, it's not cheap. You can get a better one at, say, Tropical Smoothie Cafe where you get a fruit smoothie, a wrap, and a bag of chips and no subscriptions. Do yourself a favor and avoid this company. They seem to care only about making that shipment and charging your card.",1
5015,Fresh N Lean,(Edit) Damaged Order no response in 4 days,This is an update to my situation. I still have not received a response via email. I did reach out via the chat feature and was promptly refunded for the order. I am happy with the solution. They do need to work on their email response rate though. Moving from 2 stars to 3 due to lack of communication. Original issue:I Received my order Friday Dec 29. The packaging looked as if it had been kicked around a bunch. Similar to that scene in Ace Ventura. I immediately contacted Fresh direct with pictures of the filthy contents and the broken meal. The meals were no longer within the insulating cocoon and might have gotten warm. Here it is January 3. No response. (To be clear I did receive an automated acknowledgment of receipt) Poor customer service. A few of the meals started to bloat before their expiry dates on previous orders as well.,3
5016,Fresh N Lean,Don't trust any of there promotions,"Don't trust any of there promotions! I made the mistake of signing up, thinking I was getting a discount.  Later. I realized I was charged the full fee. Customer service is a joke. There's no phone number.  I sent multiple emails with no response. To top it off, several of the meals were inedible.  Some of them loss the vacuum seal and seemed to have turned. Others were still sealed but was the worst meals I've tasted in my 20 years as a vegetarian.  Absolutely ridiculous!",1
5017,Fresh N Lean,The goal of preparing fresh meals to‚Ä¶,"The goal of preparing fresh meals to fit various needs is a worthy one.  I see from the shipping address that the foods are prepared not far from my home.  Vacuum packing helps to preserve the meals until they are opened so freezing is not necessary.   Unfortunately some foods lose their flavor, and some their texture in the process.  Eggs overcook too easily.  Red pepper is used to stimulate the taste buds which is not agreeable to everyone.",3
5018,Fresh N Lean,Great customer service,"I had some issues with the site and how they convey information. But after talking to customer service I realized it had less to do with greed and more to do with a misunderstanding. That and I should take ownership of my own mistakes too. But what made this a 5-star experience for me was how they responded. The rep I was talking to was very kind, helped me understand how the site worked, and refunded 50% of my order. I know I can't send the food back after it's sent out, so I think this is a fair deal.As far as pre-cooked meal deliveries go, you can't go wrong with them. The food itself is tasty, packaged well, and heats in minutes. And their customer service is fantastic!I will consider using them again in the future.",5

Most of the meals were bland but still had a high sodium (30%DV ), high fat (30%DV)and high calorie content for small portions (400+). This nutritional profile is similar to a full flavor $5 dollar frozen Egg Plant Parmesan.  My first order was short a meal and had wrong items. They provided a partial credit to my account for future use but I decided to cancel after a 2 week trial rather than pay full price for unreliable service and bland food. The credit was useless to me. I still got emails reminding me to pick meals even though I canceled. 1 star for: It arrived well packaged. 1 star for: I liked one dish with pesto that had full flavor. This service was not for me.",2

It is worth noting I listed the issues clearly and provided images backing up my claims.Support was very polite and seemed experienced in resolving issues.",5
5025,Fresh N Lean,Still not sure...,"I have been using Fresh N'Lean for 2 weeks now and have eaten about 9 meals so far. Of those, I've liked about 6 of them. As of now, I am going to continue using the service and start filtering out the ingredients that I've found I don't like. For example, their quinoa is very dry and the eggplant is very hard (even though I love both of these when I get them elsewhere). Other ingredients/meals so far have tasted pretty good. (Of note, I do have to add a ton of salt and pepper to make them flavorful, but that is not a problem.) I feel like right now the meals are hit or miss. I want to see how things go for a few more weeks as I learn to filter out the ingredients I don't like. If I am still not liking 33% of the meals I receive, I will probably cancel. As far as ordering and delivery go, it has gone very smoothly. Always delivered on Friday afternoon and easy to log into the website and choose meals. I also like that as of recently we no longer have to stick to a specific meal plan and can choose from all the meals. I think this is important because not everyone is on a specific diet (eg, paleo, keto, etc.) Some of us just want to eat healthy and should be able to choose from all the meal options.",3

5027,Fresh N Lean,This company is like no other,"This company is like no other.  It is so easy to complain but not enough people appreciate.  I have ordered food from this company for the past 1-1/2 years from Honolulu, Hawaii.  Although I pay an extra shipping charge, I don't mind too much since the food is spectacularly delicious, and the customer service is even more amazing.  I still feel the salmon and shrimp are both overcooked but tastewise, is delicious.  The chicken meatballs are absolutely amazing (they are the best), and the different chicken dishes offered are equally delicious.  If they stopped overcooking the salmon and shrimp and brought back the butternut squash soup, I would be over the moon with happiness.  I'm still crossing my fingers.  I will not be exploring any other companies since I have friends who have told me they are disappointed with the consistency of food and customer service.  Trust me -- try this company.  You will not regret it.  Even better - they now have a new service where you can choose between different types of meal plans.  WOWEE!",5

5030,Fresh N Lean,A meal nightmare,"I have tried several different delivery meal services and I've got to say that this is been the most horrible experience I've ever had with any delivery meals. First of all, I was charged the incorrect price from the beginning. Had to call and get a refund. Secondly, their website is so absolutely confusing that I ended up ordering two separate orders and didn't even realize it. So I was getting twice the amount of meals. The most confusing website I've ever experienced for this type of service.  All the other ones are straightforward and very user friendly. After canceling the meals, I still received an additional shipment. After I was told it was canceled from one of their representatives. I had to call again and get another refund. And lastly, the way they wrap the meals to me is absolutely unhealthy. I don't want plastic plastered to my meal and I would never microwave my meals. This is the only company that seal wraps the plastic right to the meal",1
5031,Fresh N Lean,STAY AWAY FROM THE BREAKFASTS,"STAY AWAY FROM THE BREAKFASTS. I‚Äôm in a hotel for two weeks for work so I got Fresh N Lean because it seemed like the perfect opportunity to try it. The lunches and dinners are good. A little small on the portions I‚Äôm a 140lb 5‚Äô7 women who is active and was hungry fairly often after eating a meal. Now, I got all the meals which was a mistake because breakfast is more akin to prison food. All the meals include eggs which is just not something that should be reheated at all and the meats in particular taste like cat food somehow only in the breakfast options though. I don‚Äôt know why the quality and thought is lacking in their breakfast options but needless to say, they went in the trash because I couldn‚Äôt stomach them. If I got again would most certainly not get breakfast but might try lunch and dinner again.",3
5032,Fresh N Lean,Good food but bad everything else,"Ok, the food is actually clean (low in sodium, healthy ingredients, etc.). That‚Äôs the only highlight. Everything else is not great. Signing up for an account on Fresh N Lean automatically forces you into getting a delivery for the upcoming week (no ability to cancel that first delivery). And, if you signed up for an account after Friday, you have no choice in the food you‚Äôre getting. The website is really bad (there‚Äôs even a ‚Äúdev‚Äù in the title of it meaning it‚Äôs not even the production version of the website; if you click on something, it doesn‚Äôt do anything sometimes. And, if it does, it takes forever to load. Sometimes settings you change aren‚Äôt persisted. I canceled my subscription and then when I log out and log back in, it says the account is active. Even if you cancel a subscription, you can still get charged for a delivery somehow‚Ä¶ none of it makes sense). The customer support is impossible to reach.

My most recent had 2 items missing that apparently fell out of the box. The issue is as simple as the quality of the boxes that are not able to hold up to shipping with cold packs.  This is something they refuse to admit and blame the shipping companies (they have used 3 companies for my orders).  The boxes nearly fall apart when you pick them up and they use the absolute minimum amount of tape on the boxes.   Spending an extra $0.50/box would probably fix the issue.",3

5066,Fresh N Lean,Wrong meals and shipping issues,"This was the final straw.  I've had several issues in the past.  Mostly, the wrong meals were sent and missing meals.  At least on 4 shipments.  This week, my order was never received. The meals are decent and the price seems reasonable, thus the 2 stars.",2
5067,Fresh N Lean,I do not understand the positive‚Ä¶,I do not understand the positive reviews. They have messed up my order literally every time. They also don‚Äôt honor my exclusions as the substitution meals they place in my order all contain things I can‚Äôt eat or don‚Äôt like. They regularly lose shipments and then ship a new order out that has none of the meals I selected in it. This time 4 out of 5 of the substitution meals they sent included the ingredients I don‚Äôt like. This is such an expensive service for how unreliable it is. They never inform you of the substitutions either. You just get the meals and what‚Äôs in the box doesn‚Äôt even match the packing slip in most cases.,1
5068,Fresh N Lean,Efficient and Helpful,"I received a promo credit but had changed my meal types halfway through setting up the account and was concerned I'd messed up the credit application. As there is an hour window to complete changes to selected meals, I emailed the company to ensure the promo credit was applied and make changes if needed. I was directed to the live chat to expedite my request and connected to a live rep quickly without having to spend time going in circles with a chatbot. This I appreciate immensely, as chatbots can be very frustrating at times! The customer service rep was expedient and thorough in addressing my question, and the whole experience was pleasant, quick, and easy! <3",5

I always heat mine up in a toaster oven and the vegetables have always been crisp and tasty.The meals are filling and the proportions are large enough that it feels like a full meal. Everything I have eaten I thought has been really good. The menu is large to choose from and I really like that you can elect to have certain items not included. For instance, I select to not have bell peppers because I have a mild allergy to them. I have really enjoyed knowing I am eating healthy food that I don't have to prep for lunch!",5

5077,Fresh N Lean,** Review for Fresh N Lean Prepared Organic Food Delivery Service**,"I recently tried out Fresh N Lean, drawn in by their organic food offerings and an appealing first-order discount. Their website and app were user-friendly, making navigation a breeze. I was pleasantly surprised by the extensive menu options they provide, including vegan, keto, paleo, and more. For the vegan category alone, they offered 10 different entr√©es for that week!Shipping was prompt. The order arrived in an insulated box, ensuring the meals remained cold. Each entr√©e is vacuum-sealed with nutrition details, consumption date, and easy-to-follow heating instructions. I tasted three items and was impressed by the perfect balance of flavors.However, there was a hiccup with my billing. I was charged the full amount, without the discount. I approached their customer service with some apprehension, but I was immediately assisted by Jen S. After providing evidence of the discount code, my browser crashed. When I reconnected, I was helped by Queen B, who had spoken to Jen and was updated on the situation. Thanks to their combined efforts, my bill was amended with store credit.What stood out was the company's genuine care for its customers. Not only did they resolve my billing issue, but Queen B also provided additional credit for the inconvenience. The experience left me convinced about being a loyal customer.In conclusion, Fresh N Lean excels in both product quality and customer service. If they maintain this level of commitment to their customers, they're bound for continued success.",5
5078,Fresh N Lean,I am very impressed with this company,"I am very impressed with this company. The food has been really good every week. Since starting this service a couple months ago I have lost 20lbs by simply eating 2-3 of the meals a day with a protein shake and small snack.

5081,Fresh N Lean,I love the food but hate the website,"I love the food! Only food I haven‚Äôt liked on the vegan plan is that mushroom protein stuff. Gross. My main problems have to do with the website. There is only a very short period of time when I can pick my meals so I usually forget and miss it. There‚Äôs no way for me to communicate any preferences ahead of time so that when I do miss picking my meals I get what I want. In my case I want the higher protein vegan options. Also, I can‚Äôt view the calorie level or other nutrition info when picking my meals for the week so I have to have two tabs open to see the weeks meal plan in one (which has that info) and the meal picker in another tab. Other sites allow you access to all the info when picking options so this is really too bad.",3

However, some of their food options on that plan are on the high side of Sat Fats, Cholesterol and Sodium, in which others have mentioned on social media to them as well.  Many of these meals should be below a certain value based on the recommendations of the AHA and WHO...being the whole premise behind the Mediterranean diet, is to mitigate these high risk factors. The food taste wise isn't bad, they just need to lower these value for customers who may be eating 2 or 3 of their meals a day.",4

5101,Fresh N Lean,So far so good(-ish),"I wanted to find a way to get a more diverse and balanced diet and heard about this company online. So far, after 4 deliveries on 2 different plans, kind of a mixed bag.Pros:- Convenient (obviously :))- Meal trays, shipping box and insulation easy to recycle- Good quantity (especially on the Protein+ plan)- Varied menu- Easy to get ready, good freshness and texture even after microwave- Reliable delivery time (it's not guaranteed, but all my delivery have come in the same 1h window so far)- Customer is responsive and reasonably attentive, albeit it's not very fast (possibly understaffed?).Cons:- Packaging quality is lacking to the point where insulation has been compromised several times (already reached out to them, promised they'd do better)- Package tracking info sometimes not timely shared- Plastic cover of the dish hard to recyle- Menu on the Mediterranean plan was a little weird to be honest- Menu leans heavily towards spicy dishes, even for the ""non-spicy"" ones. Always a decent amount of black pepper or pepper flakes in pretty much every dish. Makes things not as pleasant for people like me, since you can't really ""unspice"" a dish. The box says to add pepper as preferred... but that's never really been a concern for me.Anyway, I will keep going for now, might try another service if the cons start feeling too much.",3

Initially everything was fantastic - sure, I didn't enjoy every meal, but most of them were very good and the ones I didn't care for, I simply didn't order again.  Back in June, I received an order and after eating was immediately sick - turns out they had mistakenly sent me meals with Gluten in them (I'm Celiac).  They were very quick to refund my order and apologize for the mistake.  A few weeks later, 2 of the meals were rotten.  Again - I was credited but no corrective action/root cause was given.  A few weeks later, they sent 6 incorrect meals.  I spoke with customer support and they credited me for the incorrect ones and supposedly marked my account so that a supervisor would have to verify my orders before they shipped out. Now, two weeks later, I received incorrect meals again.  The chat support person eluded to an ""investigation in the fulfillment department"" but couldn't commit to any performance improvement.  Really sad.",1

We called and were told they ran out of those meals and there were no comparable substitutions, so they just canceled it. We have been issued a credit to use on our next purchase.

I even logged out to go back and decide later with my wife and next thing I'm receiving an email thanking me for my purchase. I can't tell you how much that pissed me off. So I cancelled everything because to that and I doubt if I will ever go back to your site or any others for that matter. I hear this all the time when I ask anyone if they ever used meal prep kits and they all say the same thing that they just want to look without having to input personal and payment info before you can look around. I'm even scared to log back in thinking I might trigger another purchase. You let me know when I can browse your site without worrying about be charged for  something I have not even chosen yet.

5154,Fresh N Lean,"Nice try, but way below the mark","I did the Mediterranean diet for about two weeks. Meals are meh in terms of flavor or options. Vegetables seem to be limited to brussel sprouts, onions & bell peppers (LOADS OF ONIONS AND BELL PEPPERS) asparagus (that is not cooked enough) and mystery veggies (hard to identify by sight or texture what indeed you are eating.).Proteins are limited to chicken, shrimp and white fish - what kind of fish??? Tilapia which is farmed and not the best option?? Just about everything tasted the same, some weird bitter, vinegary, old garlic taste? Breakfasts leave much to be desired. Eggs are rubbery and the chicken sausage has zero seasoningPlastic wrap is hard af to remove - I have to use scissors every time.Last order, I picked particular meals; upon delivery, I received two additional breakfasts I didn't order (one I would never chose), a duplicate of a meal I wouldn't have necessarily ordered as a duplicate and missing a meal I did order. When I contacted customer service, first I get a bot response, then I get a human who asks me to send over photos of the delivery. This is THREE days after the fact. Who has time for that?There is NO delivery flexibility - its Friday guaranteed Saturday - so basically, be home on the weekend to receive your meals. Other programs have MUCH more flexible deliveries. PLEASE NOTE: If you are dissatisfied with your delivery, you will already be too late to cancel or pause your next delivery - forcing you to pay for and accept another week of lackluster and likely incorrect meals.
